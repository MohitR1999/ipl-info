With both teams in solid form, this daytime encounter promises to be a compelling watch.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Gujarat Titans, currently sitting at the top of the points table, are riding a wave of momentum. After a narrow defeat to Punjab Kings in their opener, they&rsquo;ve bounced back emphatically with four consecutive wins. Their batting unit is firing on all cylinders &mdash; Jos Buttler has been providing brisk starts, while Sai Sudharsan has anchored the middle order with remarkable consistency. The real X-factor for GT, though, has been R Sai Kishore. The left-arm spinner has been exceptional, tying up batters with tight lines and picking up crucial wickets, particularly through the middle overs.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lucknow Super Giants, placed sixth, have three wins from five matches. Nicholas Pooran has been in stellar form with the bat, finishing games with authority. Support from Mitchell Marsh and Aiden Markram has strengthened the middle order, giving LSG a well-rounded batting unit. With the match being played in familiar home conditions, LSG will look to bring their A-game and challenge Gujarat&rsquo;s winning streak.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The pitch at Ekana is expected to assist slower bowlers, making this a tactical battle between two smartly built sides. A lot will depend on how both teams adapt during the afternoon heat and handle the slow, gripping surface.<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (17)_1744449389.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report |&nbsp; Shane Watson &amp; Murali Kartik<\/strong><br \/>\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on Pitch No. 6 today, which has already seen runs galore. The black soil base and those big square boundaries&mdash;63m one side, 70m the other&mdash;should favor batters. Strangely enough, bowlers haven&rsquo;t really enjoyed the help they might expect from such dimensions.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a good-looking strip with a healthy grass cover and a bit of shine. In the previous outing, LSG put up 203 here. The surface has enough bounce to allow pacers to dig it in short and extract something with change-ups. Five of the ten wickets last time came off balls that hit the deck.&ldquo;This could be another high-scoring afternoon. With teams now finding success defending totals, the smart call might just be to win the toss and bat first.&rdquo;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (17)_1744451740.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Venue Stats Since TATA IPL 2024&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (8)_1744451777.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE:<\/strong>&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/><span style=\"color:#000099\"><strong>Won The Toss And Elected To Field<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Both sides come into this game eager to turn their fortunes around, having suffered defeats in their previous outings.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Chennai Super Kings, five-time IPL champions, have endured a rough patch after a bright start. They opened their campaign with a memorable win over Mumbai Indians but have since lost four games on the bounce. To add to their woes, captain Ruturaj Gaikwad has been ruled out of the tournament with an elbow injury. In a much-anticipated twist, MS Dhoni&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"enlightened\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/cool.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"enlightened\" \/> returns as captain, hoping to bring stability and inspiration to a side in need of direction. With the bat, CSK have lacked firepower and consistency, and they&rsquo;ll need their experienced names to deliver. On the bowling front, Noor Ahmad has been a reliable spin option, while Khaleel Ahmed has impressed with his new-ball spells in the Powerplay.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Kolkata Knight Riders are also coming off a close loss, falling short by just four runs against Lucknow Super Giants in a high-scoring contest. With three defeats in five matches, KKR find themselves in the lower half of the table. While their batting has shown flashes of brilliance, they&rsquo;ve struggled to close out games. This trip to Chepauk presents an opportunity to reset and bounce back with a statement performance.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>With two heavyweights desperate for momentum, MS Dhoni&rsquo;s captaincy return and Chepauk&rsquo;s spin-friendly conditions add extra intrigue. Will CSK break their losing streak at home, or can KKR spoil the party and climb back up the table?

And once again, spin, strategy, and smarts will come into play. <strong>Deep Dasgupta and Matthew Hayden<\/strong> gave us the lowdown from the centre, and it&rsquo;s fascinating.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tonight&rsquo;s battle will unfold on a <strong>black soil deck that&rsquo;s seen action once before &mdash; CSK&rsquo;s only win this season vs MI<\/strong>. But unlike that slower surface, <strong>this one&rsquo;s firmer, harder, and carries a lovely sheen of rolled-in grass<\/strong>, giving it a bit more bounce and pace.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <strong>dimensions? Compact sideways &mdash; 68 and 65 meters &mdash; with a meatier 80 meters straight<\/strong>. That means <strong>batters will fancy going square<\/strong>, but the long straight boundaries will keep bowlers in the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now here&rsquo;s the kicker: <strong>if dew stays away, expect grip and bounce to play a part<\/strong>, especially for spinners. But&nbsp;batting second could become a breeze if it shows up like it did last night.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Haydos&rsquo; verdict? &ldquo;Not quite a 200 surface, but much better for batting.&rdquo;<\/strong> Expect competitive totals in the 170-180 range &mdash; and toss could be crucial tonight.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (35)_1744379760.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Toss Update:<\/strong> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&nbsp;has won the toss and elected to bowl first&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/><\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

After winning the toss and opting to bowl first, KKR&rsquo;s spinners completely dismantled CSK&rsquo;s batting unit on a sluggish surface.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>CSK were restricted to just 103\/9 in their 20 overs &mdash; a total that never truly challenged the visitors. Shivam Dube top-scored with 31 off 29, while Vijay Shankar chipped in with 29 runs. The rest of the batting faltered badly against disciplined spells from Sunil Narine (3\/13), Varun Chakaravarthy (2\/22), and Harshit Rana (2\/16). The hosts collapsed in clusters, losing wickets at regular intervals and failing to find any rhythm throughout the innings.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In reply, KKR made short work of the modest target, chasing it down in just 10.1 overs. Sunil Narine smashed a blistering 44 off 18 balls, setting the tone with his fearless hitting. Quinton de Kock (23) and Ajinkya Rahane (20*) provided support, while Rinku Singh (15* off 12) finished it off in style.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/205aea18-0a96-45f6-bd61-c116ba46a8e9_1744391510.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>MS Dhoni (Chennai Super Kings Captain):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>&quot;Some nights just don&rsquo;t roll in your favour, and this was another one of those. We&rsquo;ve got to return to the basics, reassess where we&rsquo;re faltering, and accept the challenge head-on. The truth is&mdash;we just didn&rsquo;t have enough on the board today.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>The ball was holding up again, like it has in a few games where we bowled first. But if you keep losing wickets in clusters, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the pitch is doing&mdash;it becomes a tough game. We never really stitched together a partnership and that put a lot of pressure on the incoming batters.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>That said, it&rsquo;s not all doom and gloom. We&rsquo;ve played some solid cricket earlier this season. What&rsquo;s crucial is that we stay true to our strengths. Our openers are quality players&mdash;they don&rsquo;t need to slog, they need support and time to build. We can&rsquo;t afford to be chasing the scoreboard too early. If we&rsquo;re losing three or four in the powerplay, we&rsquo;re only making it harder for the middle order. It&rsquo;s about being smart, trusting the process, and building partnerships that win you games.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ajinkya Rahane (Kolkata Knight Riders Captain):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&quot;We came in with a clear mindset, a lot of thought went into our plans. Having spent a couple of years here in Chennai, both Moeen and Bravo had their say as well. We expected the surface to play a touch better, but it turned out a bit more sluggish than anticipated. That said, our plans came through beautifully tonight.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>When it comes to what we had in store for CSK, I&rsquo;ll keep that under wraps&mdash;still a long road in the tournament, and cards need to be kept close to the chest.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Swapping Johnson for Moeen? On a night like this, it felt like the right move. Moeen showed great maturity, especially considering he&#39;s been in and out of the XI. He stuck to his strengths and delivered under pressure. Varun and Sunny were outstanding&mdash;they completely owned the middle overs. Vaibhav and Harshit at the top were clinical. It was a total team effort.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>On a personal note, I&rsquo;ve been keeping things simple. Been grinding hard over the last two years, especially in this format, and now it&rsquo;s all coming together.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>We didn&rsquo;t talk about net run rate at the start, but once we got a foothold in the game, we saw the opportunity. We pushed for a quick finish to give that NRR a healthy bump. It&rsquo;s all about momentum from here&mdash;no more alternate wins, we want to string them together.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sunil Narine (Player of the Match):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&quot;That felt close to a complete performance.

The stakes are high, and the excitement is palpable as these two top teams clash in a battle for supremacy.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>RCB have been on a tear, with impressive victories against top-notch opponents in Chennai, Mumbai, and Kolkata. Their only loss in the tournament came against the table-toppers Gujarat Titans. The batting unit has been led by the consistent Kohli, Patidar, and Salt, while the bowling department has shown promise with the trio of Hazlewood, Bhuvi, and Dayal.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Meanwhile, DC are riding high as the only unbeaten team in the tournament. They&#39;re looking to continue their momentum, and their journey has been marked by signs of brilliance from every individual. Ashutosh Sharma&#39;s match-winning performance in the first game, followed by Mitchell Starc&#39;s brilliant bowling display against SRH, and a thrilling win against CSK at the MA Chidambaram Stadium after 15 long years, have all contributed to their impressive start.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This high-octane encounter promises to be an electrifying one! Will DC continue their dominance and remain unbeaten, or will RCB halt their streak and claim their first home win of the season? The M.

Yes, after a loss, questions come up &mdash; should we have chased, should we have done something different?

When you can&rsquo;t easily pick a Player of the Match, that&rsquo;s the hallmark of a complete team effort.Captaincy becomes easy when you have this kind of bowling unit.

So it&#39;s a joy to contribute and help the team get the win tonight.The pitch was seaming early on, so we had to assess quickly. You can&rsquo;t take too much time in T20s, so we made the most of the second half of the powerplay. The plan was simple &mdash; keep wickets in hand, and it worked beautifully.There&rsquo;s a clear understanding within the group. If we lose early wickets, the set batter takes responsibility. If not, we make sure to give the hitters a solid platform so they can explode in the final 5&ndash;7 overs.Personally, I always focus on what I can improve. I&#39;m working on my game awareness and refining my skills. Honestly, I just try to keep my basics strong &mdash; and that&rsquo;s helping me evolve into a more versatile batter.&rdquo;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n","MatchRow":23,"ProjectedScore":"164","2ndProjectedScore":"0","3rdProjectedScore":"0","MOM":"Sai Sudharsan","MOM_TYPE":"Batting","MOMPlayerId":"976","MOMRuns":"82","MOMBalls":"53","MOMWicket":"-","MOMRC":"-","MOMImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/co2jlQMK681742809071976.png","KO":""},{"CompetitionID":203,"MatchID":1820,"MatchTypeID":8,"MatchType":"T20 (N)","MatchStatus":"Post","MatchDate":"2025-04-08","MatchDateNew":"8 Apr 2025","MatchName":"Punjab Kings vs Chennai Super Kings","MatchTime":"19:30","GMTMatchTime":"14:00 GMT","GMTMatchDate":"2025-04-08","GMTMatchEndTime":"18:29 GMT","GMTMatchEndDate":"2025-04-08","FirstBattingTeamID":15,"FirstBattingTeamName":"Punjab Kings","SecondBattingTeamID":13,"SecondBattingTeamName":"Chennai Super Kings","FirstBattingTeamCode":"PBKS","SecondBattingTeamCode":"CSK","GroundID":131,"GroundName":"New PCA Stadium","Commentss":"Punjab Kings Won by 18  Runs ","TossTeam":"Punjab Kings","TossDetails":"Punjab Kings Won The Toss And Elected To Bat","TossText":" Won The Toss And Elected To Bat","Flag":1,"FirstBattingSummary":"219\/6 (20.0 Ov)","SecondBattingSummary":"201\/5 (20.0 Ov)","ClientMatchID":"","MATCH_COMMENCE_START_DATE":"2025-04-08 19:30:00","city":"New Chandigarh","FlickrAlbumID":"","LiveStream":"","FBURL":"https:\/\/www.district.in\/events\/punjab-kings-team","T20ProMatchID":"","Temperature":"","WeatherIcon":"","TempUpdatedDate":"","GroundUmpire1ID":314,"GroundUmpire2ID":574,"GroundUmpire3ID":87,"RefereeID":87,"HomeTeamID":"15","HomeTeamName":"Punjab Kings","HomeTeamColor1":"#319490","HomeTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamColor1":"#319490","AwayTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamID":"13","AwayTeamName":"Chennai Super Kings","timezone1":"Asia\/Kolkata","MatchEndDate":"8 Apr 2025","MatchEndTime":"23:59","MATCH_NO_OF_OVERS":"20","ROUND_ID":"0","MatchTypeName":"T20","RowNo":22,"TeamType":null,"CompetitionName":"Tata Ipl 2025","GroundUmpire1":"Ulhas Gandhe","GroundUmpire2":"Abhijit Bhattacharya","ThirdUmpire":"Virender Kumar Sharma","Comments":"Punjab Kings Won by 18  Runs ","HomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/PBKS.png","AwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/CSK.png","MatchHomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/PBKS.png","MatchAwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/CSK.png","VideoScorecard":0,"TimeZone":"+9.5","CurrentStrikerID":"2019-100mb00000000061-6d68257c17f311","CurrentStrikerName":"Vijay Shankar","StrikerRuns":2,"StrikerBalls":2,"StrikerFours":0,"StrikerSixes":0,"StrikerSR":100,"StrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/OqmZ8sV0O2174222295661.png","CurrentNonStrikerID":"2018-100mb00000000046-06b5ba89f88b11","CurrentNonStrikerName":"Ravindra Jadeja","NonStrikerRuns":9,"NonStrikerBalls":5,"NonStrikerFours":0,"NonStrikerSixes":1,"NonStrikerSR":180,"NonStrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/D2NopaO23i174262923646.png","CurrentBowlerID":"2022-100mb00000001550-b8b1d54854ee11","CurrentBowlerName":"Yash Thakur","BowlerOvers":"4.0","BowlerRuns":39,"BowlerMaidens":0,"BowlerWickets":1,"BowlerEconomy":9.75,"BowlerSR":24,"BowlerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/qNuYIM3nxb17428933071550.png","ChasingText":"","MatchBreakComments":"","MatchProgress":"","CurrentInnings":"2","1Summary":"219\/6 (20.0 Overs)","1FallScore":"219","1FallWickets":"6","1FallOvers":"20.0","1RunRate":"10.95","2Summary":"201\/5 (20.0 Overs)","2FallScore":"201","2FallWickets":"5","2FallOvers":"20.0","2RunRate":"10.05","3Summary":"","3FallScore":"","3FallWickets":"","3FallOvers":"","3RunRate":"","4Summary":"","4FallScore":"","4FallWickets":"","4FallOvers":"","4RunRate":"","5Summary":"","5FallScore":"","5FallWickets":"","5FallOvers":"","5RunRate":"","6Summary":"","6FallScore":"","6FallWickets":"","6FallOvers":"","6RunRate":"","DivisionID":"6","SecondInningsFirstBattingID":null,"SecondInningsFirstBattingName":"","SecondInningsSecondBattingID":null,"SecondInningsSecondBattingName":"","ThirdInningsFirstBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsFirstBattingName":"","ThirdInningsSecondBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsSecondBattingName":"","WinningTeamID":"15","MatchOrder":"Match 22","RevisedOver":"","RevisedTarget":"","PreMatchCommentary":"<p><strong>Fasten your seatbelts, folks!

Their campaign took a hit with a hefty loss against Rajasthan, but with Shreyas Iyer at the helm and young guns like Nehal Wadhera firing, they&rsquo;ve got the firepower. Ricky Ponting will be urging his boys to bring the heat&mdash;especially with spin being their Achilles heel last time out.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>On the other side, the mighty Chennai Super Kings are looking for answers. Three losses on the bounce, and questions being asked of the top order. MS Dhoni&rsquo;s doing the job with the bat lower down, but CSK need their engine room to start firing. Ruturaj and the boys will know: you don&rsquo;t win titles in April, but you sure can lose momentum.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Expect spin to play a big part, toss to be crucial, and pressure to be sky-high.

Both teams come into this match off losses. Notably, we&rsquo;ve switched pitches. The boundaries are different now, with the square boundaries at 7m and the straight boundary stretching to 74m. Batters, especially right-handers, will likely target the leg side. Michael Clarke is with me. Looking at the pitch, it resembles the one used in Punjab Kings&#39; match against the Royals. Dew doesn&#39;t seem like a factor tonight.Both wickets look similar, and though you can spot a few dry patches, the surface remained pretty steady on Saturday. I don&rsquo;t think the toss will have a huge impact. The key here is the length of your deliveries. Overpitching is beneficial for the batters as the ball comes onto the bat nicely, allowing them to hit through the line. But if you bowl too short, especially with slower pace, it&rsquo;ll play into the batters&rsquo; hands. Hitting the top of the stumps length is the sweet spot here. That&rsquo;s the key in both the powerplay and at the death.&quot;&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (14)_1744120876.gif\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE : <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" \/><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&nbsp;Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Despite a middle-order wobble, Shashank Singh (52 off 36)* and Marco Jansen (34 off 19)* added late firepower, pushing PBKS to a daunting 219\/6. Arya&rsquo;s strokeplay was ruthless &mdash; 9 sixes and 7 boundaries in a fearless inning that laid the foundation.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>CSK&rsquo;s chase began briskly with Rachin Ravindra (36) and Devon Conway (69 retired out) building a solid platform. But a mid-innings squeeze and regular wickets &mdash; including Dube (42) and Dhoni (27 off 12) &mdash; slowed their momentum. A tactical retire-out of Conway raised eyebrows, but even late fireworks from Dhoni and Jadeja couldn&#39;t bridge the gap as CSK finished at 201\/5.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lockie Ferguson (2\/40) and Maxwell (1\/11) delivered crucial breakthroughs, while Yash Thakur held his nerve at the death. With this win, PBKS not only get off the mark at home but also hand CSK a reality check in the race to the playoffs.&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad | Chennai Super Kings Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>&ldquo;In the last four games, dropped catches have been the real difference. Every time we miss one, the same batter adds 20&ndash;30 extra runs &mdash; that&rsquo;s costly. If you take out the RCB game, our last three losses have come down to just two or three big hits.Credit to Priyansh &mdash; he played fearless cricket, took risks, and they paid off. Even though we kept picking wickets, they maintained the pressure and momentum. Maybe 10&ndash;15 runs fewer, with better execution and catching, and it could&rsquo;ve been a different story.From a batting point of view, today was spot-on. Our best players against pace were up the order and made full use of the powerplay. Conway timed the ball well early on, but once we saw him slowing down, we made the call to bring in Jaddu for the finishing role.We&rsquo;re emphasizing fielding &mdash; told the team to enjoy it, not feel nervous. One good catch or boundary save can lift the entire group. While you can have off days with bat or ball, fielding is all about mindset &mdash; and it&rsquo;s something we must improve going forward.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shreyas Iyer | Punjab Kings Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&ldquo;This is the template we&rsquo;re looking to build &mdash; no matter the ground. We have variety, power, and great timing throughout our batting unit.Priyansh was simply outstanding today. I had a chat with him last match when he looked a bit unsure against Jofra. But today, he went out with total clarity. Backed his instincts, went after the ball when it was there, and played one of the best knocks I&rsquo;ve seen in the IPL so far.&nbsp;That was a tactical call. Dube was set, Conway was still at the crease. We felt pace-off deliveries into the pitch would be more effective at that stage. Yuzi is a class bowler, no doubt, but sometimes you have to trust your gut in crunch moments &mdash; and it worked out today.We&rsquo;re yet to put together a perfect game. Fielding is a mindset &mdash; once the boys start attacking the ball fearlessly, we&rsquo;ll get there. We&rsquo;ll regroup, train harder, and work on turning those half-chances into moments that win us matches.&rdquo;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Priyansh Arya | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>&ldquo;Sir, it feels out of this world. I&rsquo;m really happy with my performance, but I&rsquo;m even more focused on contributing more for the team going forward<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>The intent was always to stay positive.

Straight down the ground, it&rsquo;s 69 meters.&nbsp;Day games can be unpredictable when it comes to run-scoring. Now, there is grass on this pitch, but what&rsquo;s interesting is how hard and rigid it feels to the touch. That tells me it might grip and hold a bit as the day wears on &mdash; which means batting could get tougher.&nbsp;Do you bat first or back your side to chase?&quot;Well, most captains these days love to chase and will say they&rsquo;ll assess the conditions. But personally, I&rsquo;d like to bat first here. I don&rsquo;t think this surface is going to change too much. And with those short boundaries, you&rsquo;ve got to be tactical and aware from ball one.&quot;&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (13)_1744104995.gif\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

It&#39;s easy to try too many things when you&#39;re being hit around, but discipline wins games.We also tried to slow things down when the game was moving fast. Sometimes that helps shift momentum &mdash; thankfully, it worked in our favour today.Keeping the left-right combo in the middle was a tactical call.

Once you understand that, you prepare accordingly. I&rsquo;ve been working on those areas, and thankfully, it&#39;s helping the team.Full credit to Aiden and Mitch &mdash; they&rsquo;ve been outstanding. They&rsquo;re batting with intent, building partnerships, and most importantly, playing for the team. No egos, just smart cricket.

It&#39;s Mumbai Indians versus Royal Challengers Bengaluru&mdash;a matchup that is never short on drama. Tonight, it comes with added layers of redemption and reputations on the line.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0; margin-right:0\">&nbsp;<strong>The Mumbai Indians are currently struggling, facing three losses in four matches. They have had a rough time during the PowerPlay and are still searching for a rhythm. However, Jasprit Bumrah is back&mdash;the X-factor, the enforcer, the player who can change the game with a single spell. With the ball likely to swing early in the humid Mumbai conditions, Bumrah could set the tone for his team.<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>Rohit Sharma has also returned after recovering from a knee injury. His performance at the top of the order will be crucial in lifting the spirits of an MI camp that has looked uncharacteristically shaky.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0; margin-right:0\"><strong>On the other hand, Royal Challengers Bengaluru are still trying to establish their identity this season&mdash;sometimes electric, other times exposed. After being humbled by the Gujarat Titans, they will be eager to move on quickly. Adding to the intrigue are three former MI players&mdash;Tim David, Romario Shepherd, and Nuwan Thushara&mdash;who now wear the RCB red. You can bet they will be highly motivated for this clash.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0; margin-right:0\"><strong>As for the weather, expect muggy and heavy air&mdash;think sweat, swing, and skiddy seam movement. This match isn&rsquo;t just about competing; it&rsquo;s about breaking patterns. The Mumbai Indians need to shake off their early-season slumber, while the Royal Challengers Bengaluru have yet to record a win at Wankhede against MI in the last five years.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (15)_1744031285.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL Stats At Wankhede Stadium Since 2024:<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2025-04-07T185102_1744032170.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Natalie Germanos &amp; Simon Katich:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re back at the iconic Wankhede, but not on the same track we saw earlier this season. That game was on pitch number six &ndash; today, it&rsquo;s pitch number eight. While we&rsquo;re still dealing with asymmetrical dimensions &ndash; it&rsquo;s 66 metres to the off-side, 61 to the leg-side, and a pretty long straight boundary at 74 &ndash; what&rsquo;s changed is the breeze. It&#39;s gusty here tonight in Mumbait.The wind is definitely a factor today, and you wonder if it might have an impact on the dew. If dew does come in, especially with this breeze, we know the ball skids on and becomes a nightmare for bowlers &ndash; particularly under lights. That&rsquo;s why teams prefer chasing here.Now looking at the surface &ndash; it&rsquo;s rock hard, typical Wankhede. There&rsquo;s a healthy grass cover but a few patches look barer on one end, which could bring in a little variable bounce. Not expecting much turn, to be honest &ndash; this is going to be a batter&rsquo;s paradise.One key stat &ndash; Mumbai have been poor in the powerplay this season, while RCB&rsquo;s economy rate with the new ball has been the best in the league. So it&rsquo;s going to be all about who wins that early battle &ndash; because with this outfield and these dimensions, if you don&rsquo;t get your lengths right, you&rsquo;ll be fishing the ball out of the stands. With wind in play and a pitch begging to be hit, this has all the ingredients for another Wankhede run-feast!&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (12)_1744034220.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0; margin-right:0\"><strong>TOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Skipper Rajat Patidar (64 off 32) was ruthless in the death overs, while Jitesh Sharma&#39;s 19-ball 40 added late fireworks. Trent Boult took two wickets but leaked 57 runs in his four overs.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, MI&#39;s chase was on fire thanks to Tilak Varma&#39;s explosive 56 off 29 and Hardik Pandya&rsquo;s blitz of 42 off just 15.

This win not only propels RCB up the table but also gives them a massive morale boost heading deeper into the tournament. A statement victory, and one to remember!<\/strong><br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/image - 2025-04-07T235926_1744050646.png\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hardik Pandya | MI Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;It was a high-scoring game, and we were just two hits short. Not much else to say.It was a flat wicket, tough for bowlers. You can&#39;t fault them too much&mdash;if batters connect, there&#39;s no stopping them. Maybe we fell short by 10-12 runs.Naman was always meant to bat lower down. With Rohit unavailable last game, we had to reshuffle. He&rsquo;s versatile, and with Ro back, Naman returned to his original role.He was brilliant today. People didn&rsquo;t know, but he took a hard hit before the last match. It was a tactical decision then, but today he showed real class.Powerplay is key in a chase like this. We couldn&rsquo;t capitalize in those crucial overs and fell behind. RCB executed well at the death.Having him back is massive. He did his job like always, and it&rsquo;s just great to have him in the squad.You never back down. We keep looking at the positives, keep fighting, and the results will follow. We believe in our group.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rajat Patidar | RCB Captain &amp; Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&ldquo;It was an incredible game. Very tough, but I&rsquo;m proud of how the bowlers held their nerve. This award truly belongs to the bowling unit. Defending a total at Wankhede isn&rsquo;t easy, but the way they executed their plans&mdash;especially in the death&mdash;was outstanding. Special mention to Krunal Pandya, bowling the last over under that kind of pressure and nailing it, just shows the courage in this team. Our strategy during the time-out was clear&mdash;take the game deep and save KP&rsquo;s over for the end. It worked perfectly.The pitch was a typical Mumbai deck&mdash;true bounce and great for batting. After Hardik&rsquo;s over, I felt it was time to shift gears and take the attack to them.&nbsp;In this format, wrist-spinners are key. Suyash bowled brilliantly, especially from the shorter end&mdash;he&rsquo;s a wicket-taker and showed great control.Personally, I just wanted to make an impact&mdash;put pressure on the bowlers and push the scoring rate.

With both sides at contrasting ends of form and confidence, this encounter promises to be a crucial juncture in their respective campaigns.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sunrisers Hyderabad began their season with a dominant 44-run win over Rajasthan Royals, putting up a mammoth 286 on the board. However, their form has dipped since, suffering three straight defeats. Their most recent loss came against Kolkata Knight Riders, where they were bundled out for just 120. The opening pair of Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head, who showed promise earlier, haven&rsquo;t quite found their rhythm, which has contributed to their batting woes. On the brighter side, young Aniket Verma has emerged as a dependable batter amidst the inconsistency. The bowling department, though, continues to search for breakthroughs and balance.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Gujarat Titans have shown strong signs of stability under Shubman Gill&rsquo;s leadership. After narrowly losing their opener, they bounced back with two impressive wins. Jos Buttler has been in explosive form at the top, while Sai Sudharsan has provided solidity through the middle. Left-arm spinner Sai Kishore has also delivered key spells, strengthening their bowling unit. Their recent victory over Bengaluru was a complete performance, led by Siraj&rsquo;s three-wicket haul and Buttler&rsquo;s unbeaten 73.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>With Hyderabad desperate to get back to winning ways and Gujarat aiming to continue their momentum, this contest carries significant weight. Will SRH rediscover their spark at home, or will GT&rsquo;s all-round form prevail once again?

Let&#39;s bring in our pitch expert for this match, &nbsp;This is one of those venues where it&rsquo;s a lot more comfortable doing a pitch report than actually bowling on it! That said, Pitch 4 is slightly on the slower side. Over the past three years, the highest score recorded here has been just 165, which tells you a bit about the nature of this surface. It does appear a bit dry. I spoke to the curator earlier and he mentioned the surface is expected to stay compact through the game. That means slower deliveries and off-cutters could be particularly useful&mdash;perhaps an opportunity for someone like Jaydev Unadkat to come into play today.&quot;&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (11)_1743946374.gif\" \/>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>&nbsp;TOSS UPDATE:<\/strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" \/>Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Mohammed Siraj was unplayable with the new ball. He struck twice in the powerplay, removing Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma in quick succession. Siraj finished with sensational figures of 4 for 17, including a peach to bowl Simarjeet Singh and a milestone 100th IPL wicket.Despite a few starts from Ishan Kishan (17), Nitish Kumar Reddy (31), and Heinrich Klaasen (27), SRH never built the momentum they needed. Pat Cummins&rsquo; late cameo (22* off 9) and a couple of handy blows from Shami (6* off 2) pushed the score to 152\/8&mdash;well below par on this surface.In reply, Gujarat Titans had an early wobble, losing Sai Sudharsan and Jos Buttler inside four overs. But Washington Sundar walked out at No. 4 and turned the tide. The southpaw counter-attacked with flair, hammering 49 off just 29 balls, including five boundaries and two sixes.Shubman Gill anchored the chase beautifully, timing the ball to perfection and finding gaps with surgical precision. His unbeaten 61 off 43 ensured there were no further hiccups. Sherfane Rutherford added the finishing touches with a blazing 35* off 16, carting six boundaries and a maximum to seal the chase in just 16.4 overs.The Titans&#39; clinical display with bat and ball was a statement performance. Siraj&rsquo;s new-ball burst, Gill&rsquo;s class, and Sundar&rsquo;s counter-punch proved too good for a Sunrisers&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/Postmatchnew_1743961538.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pat Cummins | Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, it wasn&rsquo;t your typical Hyderabad surface tonight. The pitch made it tough to find rhythm or fluency with the bat. We were hoping to grab a few early wickets during the powerplay to keep ourselves in the contest.It didn&rsquo;t quite turn as much as we expected either, and the bit of dew in the second innings certainly didn&rsquo;t work in our favour.We were actually torn between Chahar and Simarjeet. After watching how the surface behaved early on, we felt the pacers were getting a bit more out of it, so we backed Simarjeet to come in.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shubman Gill | Gujarat Titans Captain:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;Bowlers are true game-changers in this format. While T20 is often about power-hitting and big scores, I genuinely believe matches are won by bowlers.It was about playing proper cricketing shots, keeping it simple. Washi and I spoke about building a solid partnership &mdash; staying calm and then accelerating when needed.He was actually very close to playing against Mumbai as well. He was padded up, ready to go in. The impact player rule allowed us to balance things out with an extra bowler, but today, Washi showed his class. That knock was outstanding.The energy he brings with the ball and in the field is just contagious. When you play against him, you know he&rsquo;s a threat. When he&rsquo;s in your team, he lifts everyone &mdash; it&rsquo;s a different vibe altogether.&quot;&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mohammed Siraj | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s a special feeling to perform at my home ground, especially with my family in the stands &mdash; that energy gives you a different kind of belief.I spent seven incredible years at RCB &mdash; that place shaped me. Had my share of highs and lows there. I&#39;ve worked a lot on my bowling, my fitness, and most importantly, my mental strength. Staying in the present is something I&rsquo;ve focused on &mdash; and it&rsquo;s made a big difference.It was tough to accept &mdash; honestly, it took time to digest. But I told myself, this isn&rsquo;t the end. I focused on what I could control: mindset, preparation, and fitness.

Both teams arrive with contrasting trajectories &mdash; Punjab have looked dominant at home with back-to-back wins, while Rajasthan are seeking consistency after a mixed start.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Punjab Kings have emerged as one of the early frontrunners this season. Their success has been built on solid top-order performances, with skipper Shreyas Iyer in sublime touch. His unbeaten 97 in the opening match, followed by a steady half-century in the next, has given PBKS much-needed stability. With the ball, Arshdeep Singh has led the pace attack confidently, ably supported by a trio of multi-skilled all-rounders in Glenn Maxwell, Marco Jansen, and Marcus Stoinis. Their bowling group has looked balanced, capable of striking early and containing runs in the middle overs.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rajasthan Royals, meanwhile, will look to build on the momentum gained from their recent victory against Chennai. Nitish Rana&rsquo;s explosive knock breathed new life into their batting, while Wanindu Hasaranga&rsquo;s four-wicket haul signalled a return to form for the spin attack. The trio of Hasaranga, Theekshana, and Archer have shown encouraging signs of rhythm, and with Sandeep Sharma&rsquo;s control at the death, RR&rsquo;s bowling unit seems to be settling in well. The return of Sanju Samson as captain adds clarity to leadership, though concerns remain around Yashasvi Jaiswal&rsquo;s form at the top, with the team hopeful of a turnaround from the young opener.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>As two well-matched sides prepare to face off, this game holds the potential to shift early-season momentum. With form, match-ups, and home advantage in play, expect an intense battle when Punjab and Rajasthan take the field.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (11)_1743859459.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nToss Update: <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">PBKS bowl first after winning the toss!<\/span>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Batting first, RR piled on an imposing 205\/4, powered by Yashasvi Jaiswal&rsquo;s fluent 67 and Riyan Parag&rsquo;s explosive unbeaten 43 off 25 balls. Sanju Samson and Nitish Rana chipped in with brisk cameos, while Punjab&rsquo;s bowlers struggled to contain the flow of runs, especially in the latter stages.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In reply, Punjab Kings suffered early setbacks, losing three wickets inside the first four overs. Jofra Archer&rsquo;s fiery new-ball spell put the Royals firmly in control. However, Nehal Wadhera stood out with a spirited 62 off just 41 deliveries, keeping PBKS in the hunt during the middle phase. His stroke play was confident and well-timed, briefly giving Punjab a glimmer of hope.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Despite his efforts, wickets fell regularly at the other end. Glenn Maxwell added a quick 30, but Rajasthan&rsquo;s bowling attack &mdash; led by Archer (3\/25), Theekshana, and Sandeep Sharma &mdash; was disciplined and efficient.

That felt like a good score to chase here. Unfortunately, we couldn&rsquo;t quite execute our plans the way we intended. That said, I&rsquo;m actually glad this kind of game happened early in the tournament&mdash;it gives us a chance to reset.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>It was a decent pitch, slightly on the slower side with the ball holding up a bit. We weren&rsquo;t offering much pace, but I think we could&rsquo;ve paced our innings better&mdash;maybe slowed it down, focused on building partnerships. We lost wickets in quick succession, which made it tough for new batters to settle in.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>We had anticipated some dew, but it didn&rsquo;t show up tonight. So we&#39;ll go back, review the footage, and look at the moments where we slipped, both with bat and ball. These are crucial learnings.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>One big positive was Nehal&mdash;he was outstanding under pressure. Took his time, assessed the conditions, and then took the game to the bowlers. Performances like that are what we want to see.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sometimes, an early hiccup is just what you need to realign and sharpen your focus. I&rsquo;m confident we&rsquo;ll bounce back stronger.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sanju Samson (Rajasthan Royals Captain):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>&quot;Thank you so much. I think the way we started in the powerplay with the bat was solid, though we did end up a few runs short of where we wanted to be. But the way everyone showed their intent and batsmanship was brilliant. I had a feeling it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy for them to chase in the second innings&mdash;205 was a very good total on this surface.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>As I&rsquo;ve said before, we have a deep batting line-up. A lot of our players might be young, but they carry great potential and international experience. That really helps us manage the game better in pressure situations.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>(On Jofra Archer and Sandeep Sharma) &mdash; Absolutely, that&rsquo;s a deadly combo! One&rsquo;s coming in hot at 140, and the other&rsquo;s crafty and clever around 105. We&rsquo;re really happy with how both are going about their business. I&rsquo;ve got a lot of trust in them, especially in high-pressure overs. Jofra doing Jofra things&mdash;we love it when he cranks up the pace. And Sandy, he&rsquo;s easily one of the best death bowlers in India. Just superb.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Jofra Archer (Player of the Match):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>&quot;At the start of the tournament, games like these are bound to happen.

Both teams have shown their strengths in different ways, and this clash could be a key moment in their early-season journeys.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>CSK come into this contest with one win from three matches. After a strong start against Mumbai Indians, they&rsquo;ve faced two close losses to Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Rajasthan Royals. Captain Ruturaj Gaikwad has been among the positives with the bat, though his participation is under watch due to an elbow concern. In case he is unavailable, MS Dhoni is expected to step in as skipper. The return of Devon Conway could bolster the top order, with Rahul Tripathi possibly moving to a middle-order role. The bowling attack, particularly the spinners, will be central to CSK&rsquo;s strategy on a surface that historically supports turn. Noor Ahmad, who has already picked up nine wickets in the tournament, alongside R Ashwin, will be key assets.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Delhi Capitals have made an impressive start to the season, winning both their games so far. Their campaign began with a remarkable chase against Lucknow, and was followed by a well-rounded performance against Sunrisers Hyderabad. Youngster Ashutosh Sharma played a standout knock in the opening game, while Mitchell Starc led the bowling charge in the second with a five-wicket haul. Faf du Plessis has brought experience and stability at the top, while KL Rahul has offered valuable contributions in the middle order. Their spin duo of Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav will look to make the most of conditions in Chennai.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (10)_1743843248.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nStats At MA Chidambaram Since IPL 2024:<\/strong><br \/>\nLooking at recent data at Chepauk since IPL 2024, chasing has emerged as a slightly favourable option &mdash; teams batting second have won seven of the last 11 matches. The average first-innings score stands at 171, while teams have been particularly dominant in the Powerplay, scoring an average of 53 runs. Death overs have yielded runs at a brisk 10.3 RPO. Interestingly, pacers have had more of an impact here, claiming 69% of wickets (88 out of 128), while spinners have accounted for the remaining 31% (40 wickets), suggesting that seamers have found ways to succeed despite conditions traditionally aiding spin.<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (5)_1743844258.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report: Matthew Hayden &amp; Eoin Morgan:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Matthew Hayden: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a scorcher today, but there&rsquo;s a gentle breeze that might offer some relief to the players.

The heat drains you, and the pitch might play a touch two-paced&mdash;especially tricky for new batters trying to get in. For me, the key lies in partnerships.

Opting to bat first, DC posted a competitive total of 183\/6, thanks to a fluent 77 from KL Rahul and a late flourish from Tristan Stubbs, who remained unbeaten on 24 off 12 balls.

We&#39;re putting in the effort, trying to improve every day, but things aren&#39;t clicking. Losing too many wickets early has hurt us, and it&rsquo;s been a major concern &mdash; both with the bat and the ball in the powerplay. We&rsquo;re either conceding 15-20 extra runs or collapsing with the bat.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>I feel we&rsquo;re being a bit overcautious in those early overs &mdash; our bowlers are tentative, and batters perhaps a little too mindful of not losing wickets. It&rsquo;s about finding that balance between intent and composure. Right now, it feels like we&#39;re reacting rather than setting the tone.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Since the powerplay, we were always behind the game &mdash; playing catch-up. Once we lost early wickets, we only had one recognized batter left. Credit to DC; they bowled smartly and read the conditions better. Even with Shivam (Dube) at the crease, we were searching for momentum but couldn&rsquo;t quite find it. As a unit, we need to come together, take initiative, and make things happen.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Axar Patel (DC Captain):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t expect things to look this smooth &mdash; winning three in a row feels great, especially when everyone is contributing and the team looks well-balanced. As a captain, it&rsquo;s satisfying, but I still feel we haven&rsquo;t played that perfect game yet.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>I didn&rsquo;t bowl much today &mdash; part of it was strategic, part of it because of a finger niggle. In every match, we&rsquo;ve seen some brilliant fielding efforts and a few dropped chances too &mdash; that&rsquo;s part of the game.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>The IPL is a long tournament. Momentum can shift at any moment, so it&rsquo;s important to stay grounded and keep doing the right things.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>KL Rahul | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;I&#39;m quite used to adapting now. Before the IPL began, I was prepping to open the innings, but once I got here, the coach asked me to bat at No. 4 and I was okay with it. It&rsquo;s more of a mental adjustment &mdash; getting into a rhythm and being used to walking in at a particular time.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>When you move up and down the order, it can feel a bit unsettled at first. It takes a few balls to find that comfort, but once you&rsquo;re in, it&#39;s just bat vs ball again. I&#39;ve been working on starting positively from ball one.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Felt good to open today. I began well, got a little scratchy in the middle, but key partnerships &mdash; especially with Porel and Axar &mdash; helped. Porel&rsquo;s quick 20-25 really gave us momentum, that&rsquo;s how T20s go now. Once I got past the halfway mark, I knew I had to accelerate and looked to target specific bowlers and the shorter boundaries.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Towards the end, the heat got to me a bit &mdash; I probably left 15-20 runs out there.

With both teams registering just one win from their first three games, this clash becomes vital in setting the tone for the remainder of their campaigns. MI, thanks to a superior Net Run Rate, sit sixth on the points table, while LSG are just behind in seventh.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>Mumbai come into this fixture high on confidence after a comprehensive eight-wicket win over the defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders. That performance helped them shake off a poor start and showcased their potential in all departments. Their PowerPlay bowling came alive with Deepak Chahar and Trent Boult striking early, while debutant Ashwani Kumar stunned everyone with figures of 4\/24 &mdash; the best by an Indian on IPL debut this season. In the chase, Ryan Rickelton anchored the innings with a steady half-century, and Suryakumar Yadav provided the fireworks at the end to seal the win in style.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>LSG, however, have had an inconsistent ride. After narrowly losing to Delhi Capitals, they bounced back with a strong win over Sunrisers Hyderabad but were then outplayed by Punjab Kings. Nicholas Pooran has been their standout performer, currently holding the Orange Cap with 189 runs at an impressive average of 63. The rest of the batting unit, especially captain Rishabh Pant, needs to step up. In the bowling department, Shardul Thakur has led the way, but the support cast hasn&#39;t quite clicked yet.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWith both teams looking to build consistency, this match promises to be an intriguing contest. Can MI continue their comeback, or will LSG hold firm at home?<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (9)_1743771003.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nIPL Stats At Ekana Stadium:<\/strong><br \/>\nThe surface at the Ekana Stadium continues to be a talking point. Across 14 IPL matches played here, teams batting first and second have split wins equally at 7 apiece, suggesting the toss might not be decisive. The average first-innings score stands at 166, indicating a competitive pitch. Pacers have accounted for 61% of the wickets compared to spinners&rsquo; 39%, showing that seamers tend to have a greater impact. However, the black soil surface can still assist slower bowlers, especially in the middle overs.<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (4)_1743772867.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report &ndash; Daren Ganga:<\/strong><br \/>\n&quot;We&rsquo;re shifting from pitch number 4&mdash;red soil&mdash;to pitch number 6 today, which is black soil. That change in surface brings along a shift in dynamics. First, the dimensions: square boundaries measure 73 and 66 meters, and it&rsquo;s 78 meters straight down the ground.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about the deck. It&rsquo;s dark, almost charcoal in tone, and though there&rsquo;s a decent covering of grass, there are plenty of bare patches visible. In the last game here, seam movement was minimal, just 1.4&deg; of spin, and the bounce was true&mdash;ideal for batters to play through the line.<\/p>\n\n<p>But this black soil will play differently. Expect lower bounce and slightly slower pace off the surface. Spinners might enjoy a bit more grip and turn today. Shot-making won&rsquo;t be as free-flowing as the previous game, and timing could be key.<\/p>\n\n<p>The benchmark score batting first here? Around 181. That&rsquo;s the average first innings total, and something teams will keep in mind at the toss.&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (10)_1743774016.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Toss Update:<\/strong> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>MI has won the toss and opted to bowl first!<\/strong><\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

He was well supported by Aiden Markram (53 off 38), while David Miller played a key cameo of 27 off 14 to push the total past the 200-mark. Despite the batting firepower, MI managed to pull things back a bit towards the end, thanks to captain Hardik Pandya&rsquo;s brilliant 5-wicket haul (5\/36), which included the key scalps of Markram, Pooran, and Miller.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, MI&rsquo;s chase was jolted early as they lost Will Jacks and Ryan Rickelton cheaply. Naman Dhir brought them back with a blistering 46 off 24, while Suryakumar Yadav kept the momentum alive with a superb 67 off 43. At one stage, MI needed 52 off the final 4 overs with wickets in hand, but LSG&#39;s bowlers executed their plans perfectly under pressure.<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/LSG_1743791886.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hardik Pandya MI Captain<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, it&rsquo;s definitely disappointing when you end up on the losing side. If I&rsquo;m being honest, we gave away about 10&ndash;15 extra runs on that wicket &mdash; and in games like these, that matters.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Personally, I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed bowling. It&rsquo;s never about hunting for wickets for me. I try to read the surface, stick to smart plans, bowl tight lines, and build pressure. Dot balls create opportunities.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>With the bat, I think we came up short. We win together and we lose together &mdash; that&rsquo;s how this team functions. No finger-pointing. As a unit, we didn&rsquo;t deliver, and I take full responsibility for that.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>As for Tilak&rsquo;s retirement, it was a straightforward call. We needed a few boundaries at that stage, and sometimes in this game, things don&rsquo;t go your way even when you&rsquo;re trying your best.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Looking ahead, it&rsquo;s about simplifying things &mdash; smart bowling, calculated risks with the bat, and sticking to basics with intent. It&rsquo;s a long tournament. A couple of wins, and we&rsquo;ll be back in rhythm.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Rishabh Pant, LSG Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><strong>&quot;The wicket played really well today. Now it&#39;s about figuring out what&rsquo;s clicking for us and what&rsquo;s not. Earlier, we had a different kind of surface in mind, but then we decided to just back ourselves on whatever pitch we get.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><strong>Getting a good start always puts you ahead in the game. Marsh set the tone beautifully, and that allowed the lower middle order to capitalize later. It was a mentally challenging match &mdash; the opposition didn&rsquo;t lose too many wickets and kept the scoreboard ticking. But we stayed calm under pressure and finished strong.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><strong>[On Shardul Thakur] He&rsquo;s been outstanding for us &mdash; a terrific pick and a proper match-winner. I hope he keeps doing what he&#39;s doing. [On Rathi] He&rsquo;s one of our key bowlers this season. What impresses me most is the way he holds his nerve in crunch moments. That calmness adds real value to the team.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Digvesh Rathi, Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff\">&quot;I&rsquo;m really enjoying my bowling at the moment. My style is naturally attacking &mdash; I always look to take wickets. Watching Sunil Narine over the years has really inspired me. I admire how he bowls under pressure and delivers for his team.

Kolkata Knight Riders&nbsp;vs&nbsp;Sunrisers Hyderabad &mdash; a repeat of last year&rsquo;s grand finale, but this time, both sides are searching for traction in the early turbulence of the tournament.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>For KKR, the wounds from their collapse against Mumbai are still raw. A top-heavy batting order is holding fort, but the middle order &mdash; once their biggest weapon &mdash; has looked short of firepower and execution. Rinku Singh and Andre Russell, known for their back-end brilliance, have misfired at crucial moments, forcing the top to shoulder more than its share of the weight. Yet, there&rsquo;s promise. The veteran touch of Rahane, the flair of de Kock, and the youthful spark of Raghuvanshi hint at a core capable of pulling this team back on track.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The bowling unit, though not short on names, has lacked the killer punch. Too often they&rsquo;ve let games drift away under pressure &mdash; and it&rsquo;s this inconsistency they&rsquo;ll want to shed under the lights in the Eden gardens.On the other side, Sunrisers Hyderabad are no strangers to drama either. They lit up the league early with that statement-making performance, but that momentum seems to have fizzled out. Their explosive brand of batting, once a nightmare for bowlers, has suddenly turned patchy. Head has held the line, but others around him have drifted in and out of form. Amid the fluctuation, the rise of Aniket Verma has added a welcome jolt &mdash; fearless, fluid, and unbothered by the big stage.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>With the ball, SRH are searching for bite. The pace unit, led by Cummins and Shami, has shown flashes of rhythm but hasn&rsquo;t quite hit its stride as a collective force.The emotional undertone makes this contest truly captivating &mdash; a rematch soaked in memories, with SRH desperate to flip the script and KKR looking to reassert supremacy. It&#39;s not just about recovering points &mdash; it&#39;s about rewriting narratives.Kolkata will be buzzing. The past hangs in the balance. Two wounded sides. One shot at revival.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This is where reputations are challenged and new ones are made. Welcome to Match 15, where IPL turns the volume up once again.<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (8)_1743686465.gif\" \/>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Number&#39;s Game at Eden Gardens -&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2025-04-03T185109_1743687302.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Pitch Report |&nbsp; Pommie Mbangwa &amp; Eoin Morgan<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;The dimensions tell you a lot about what kind of game we can expect &mdash; it&rsquo;s 75 meters straight, 62 and 64 square on either side, and the boundaries behind the batter are tight, just 57 and 56 meters. If there&rsquo;s pace on offer, expect batters to use those shorter angles &mdash; the ramp, the scoop, everything&#39;s in play.As for the surface itself &mdash; it looks fantastic. Really firm, a great covering of grass across the square, and well-prepared. But right near the crease, there&rsquo;s an interesting patch &mdash; a drier area that could be a factor. If a bowler is bold enough to toss it up and get some revs on it, even with the new ball, there could be some turn early on. Batters lunging forward will need to watch out.That said, don&rsquo;t be fooled &mdash; this is still very much a batter&rsquo;s paradise. We&rsquo;re expecting a high-scoring contest. Early season, a hard deck, and if you&rsquo;re setting a target, you&rsquo;ll want 200 or more on the board. History shows even 176 has been defended, but that&rsquo;s rare.And considering the evening heat and the potential dew later on, the smart move tonight? Win the toss and bowl first. Conditions will only get better under lights, and the ball will skid on beautifully.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (8)_1743688631.gif\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/><span style=\"color:#d35400\"> Won the Toss and Elected to Field first<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Skipper Ajinkya Rahane steadied the innings with a composed 38, before the young sensation Angkrish Raghuvanshi and the ever-reliable Venkatesh Iyer stole the show. Raghuvanshi struck a crisp 50 off 32, while Iyer played a thunderous knock of 60 from just 29 balls, taking the attack to SRH&rsquo;s pace battery. Rinku Singh added late fireworks with an unbeaten 32 as KKR posted a commanding 200\/6.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In reply, SRH&#39;s top order collapsed like a house of cards. Vaibhav Arora struck early blows, dismissing Head and Kishan, while Harshit Rana removed Abhishek Sharma. The middle order offered little resistance, with only Klaasen (33) and Kamindu Mendis (27) showing some fight. Varun Chakaravarthy&rsquo;s clever variations fetched him three wickets, wrapping up the tail alongside Russell&rsquo;s double strike.This was a complete team performance from KKR &mdash; aggressive batting, sharp fielding, and disciplined bowling &mdash; while SRH were left searching for answers after yet another forgettable outing.&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/7d4fdfdb-17f5-4a62-b7fb-3ab13c61ecaa_1743714771.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pat Cummins | Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, not an ideal night for us. At the halfway mark, we felt 200 was a chaseable target on a good batting wicket. But we definitely left a few runs out there in the field, and unfortunately, fell short with the bat as well.We&rsquo;ve got to be realistic. It&#39;s been three games and things haven&rsquo;t quite clicked yet. We always back our batters to play with intent and take aggressive options&mdash;that&rsquo;s their strength. It&#39;s more about how and when we take those options, and maybe we need to explore that a bit more.In the field, we were below par. Gave away 10-15 runs extra through lapses, and KKR batted really well to capitalise.We only bowled three overs of spin, but we felt the cutters were gripping and that was the plan we went with.We&rsquo;ll address the areas that need improvement but won&rsquo;t dwell too long on it. It&rsquo;s a long tournament. Not the start we wanted, but there&rsquo;s time to turn it around. We&rsquo;ll look at where we can make smarter decisions moving forward.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ajinkya Rahane | Kolkata Knight Riders Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&quot;This was a really important win for us, and the margin of victory makes it even more satisfying. We actually wanted to bowl first too, but after losing early wickets, the discussion was about consolidating through the powerplay. The message was simple&mdash;play with intent, but sensible cricket shots. If we kept wickets in hand, our finishers could express themselves later.When Rinku and Venkatesh were at the crease, the talk was to aim for 50-60 runs in the final five overs. We had Dre, Ramandeep, and Moeen padded up and ready to go.We initially thought 170 would be a good total, but thanks to the way Rinku and Venkatesh batted, we got 30 more. We have three top-quality spinners&mdash;Moeen couldn&rsquo;t bowl today, but Sunil and Varun did a brilliant job. Credit to Vaibhav and Harshit as well. Bowling in the powerplay isn&rsquo;t easy, and Vaibhav getting those early breakthroughs set the tone perfectly.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Vaibhav Arora |&nbsp;Player of the Match:<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">&quot;I always try to stay prepared. The management lets me know well in advance whether I&rsquo;ll be used as the Impact Player, which helps me mentally gear up for the game. Once I get on the field, I try to read the conditions and adjust my bowling accordingly.During the 5th and 6th overs, there&rsquo;s not much swing, so cutters become very effective, especially tonight as the pitch was gripping. When there&rsquo;s no swing, I also like to mix in a few yorkers to keep the batters guessing.We do detailed planning for each opposition batter in our team meetings, and once we&rsquo;re out there, it&rsquo;s all about execution.Our strategy is clear&mdash;strike early in the powerplay and let our world-class spinners take over after that. We aim to pick 2-3 wickets up front to make their job easier. With bowlers like Sunil and Varun, it gives us a lot of confidence as a unit.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n","MatchRow":15,"ProjectedScore":"144","2ndProjectedScore":"0","3rdProjectedScore":"0","MOM":"Vaibhav Arora","MOM_TYPE":"Bowling","MOMPlayerId":"583","MOMRuns":"-","MOMBalls":"-","MOMWicket":"3","MOMRC":"29","MOMImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/xJwqLrId4s1742551886583.png","KO":""},{"CompetitionID":203,"MatchID":1812,"MatchTypeID":8,"MatchType":"T20 (N)","MatchStatus":"Post","MatchDate":"2025-04-02","MatchDateNew":"2 Apr 2025","MatchName":"Royal Challengers Bengaluru vs Gujarat Titans","MatchTime":"19:30","GMTMatchTime":"14:00 GMT","GMTMatchDate":"2025-04-02","GMTMatchEndTime":"18:29 GMT","GMTMatchEndDate":"2025-04-02","FirstBattingTeamID":19,"FirstBattingTeamName":"Royal Challengers Bengaluru","SecondBattingTeamID":35,"SecondBattingTeamName":"Gujarat Titans","FirstBattingTeamCode":"RCB","SecondBattingTeamCode":"GT","GroundID":12,"GroundName":"M Chinnaswamy Stadium","Commentss":"Gujarat Titans Won by 8  Wickets ","TossTeam":"Gujarat Titans","TossDetails":"Gujarat Titans Won The Toss And Elected To Field","TossText":" Won The Toss And Elected To Field","Flag":1,"FirstBattingSummary":"169\/8 (20.0 Ov)","SecondBattingSummary":"170\/2 (17.5 Ov)","ClientMatchID":"","MATCH_COMMENCE_START_DATE":"2025-04-02 19:30:00","city":"Bengaluru","FlickrAlbumID":"","LiveStream":"","FBURL":"https:\/\/shop.royalchallengers.com\/ticket","T20ProMatchID":"","Temperature":"","WeatherIcon":"","TempUpdatedDate":"","GroundUmpire1ID":314,"GroundUmpire2ID":574,"GroundUmpire3ID":87,"RefereeID":87,"HomeTeamID":"19","HomeTeamName":"Royal Challengers Bengaluru","HomeTeamColor1":"#319490","HomeTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamColor1":"#319490","AwayTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamID":"35","AwayTeamName":"Gujarat Titans","timezone1":"Asia\/Kolkata","MatchEndDate":"2 Apr 2025","MatchEndTime":"23:59","MATCH_NO_OF_OVERS":"20","ROUND_ID":"0","MatchTypeName":"T20","RowNo":14,"TeamType":null,"CompetitionName":"Tata Ipl 2025","GroundUmpire1":"Ulhas Gandhe","GroundUmpire2":"Abhijit Bhattacharya","ThirdUmpire":"Virender Kumar Sharma","Comments":"Gujarat Titans Won by 8  Wickets ","HomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/NVAlbtIyB81740555172aFPMviEPyJ1710927747rcb.png","AwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/GT.png?v=1","MatchHomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/NVAlbtIyB81740555172aFPMviEPyJ1710927747rcb.png","MatchAwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/GT.png?v=1","VideoScorecard":0,"TimeZone":"+9.5","CurrentStrikerID":"2019-100mb00000000122-ba35f672449711","CurrentStrikerName":"Sherfane Rutherford","StrikerRuns":30,"StrikerBalls":18,"StrikerFours":1,"StrikerSixes":3,"StrikerSR":166.66,"StrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/yCmE4xpdlE1742809094122.png","CurrentNonStrikerID":"2019-100mb00000000182-b78f12ef44b611","CurrentNonStrikerName":"Jos Buttler","NonStrikerRuns":73,"NonStrikerBalls":39,"NonStrikerFours":5,"NonStrikerSixes":6,"NonStrikerSR":187.17,"NonStrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/TrOBcgbhtU1742808869182.png","CurrentBowlerID":"2018-100mb00000000036-2af54408f88a11","CurrentBowlerName":"Josh Hazlewood","BowlerOvers":"3.5","BowlerRuns":43,"BowlerMaidens":0,"BowlerWickets":1,"BowlerEconomy":11.22,"BowlerSR":23,"BowlerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/NJacpRkmy8174255069936.png","ChasingText":"","MatchBreakComments":"","MatchProgress":"","CurrentInnings":"2","1Summary":"169\/8 (20.0 Overs)","1FallScore":"169","1FallWickets":"8","1FallOvers":"20.0","1RunRate":"8.45","2Summary":"170\/2 (17.5 Overs)","2FallScore":"170","2FallWickets":"2","2FallOvers":"17.5","2RunRate":"9.53","3Summary":"","3FallScore":"","3FallWickets":"","3FallOvers":"","3RunRate":"","4Summary":"","4FallScore":"","4FallWickets":"","4FallOvers":"","4RunRate":"","5Summary":"","5FallScore":"","5FallWickets":"","5FallOvers":"","5RunRate":"","6Summary":"","6FallScore":"","6FallWickets":"","6FallOvers":"","6RunRate":"","DivisionID":"6","SecondInningsFirstBattingID":null,"SecondInningsFirstBattingName":"","SecondInningsSecondBattingID":null,"SecondInningsSecondBattingName":"","ThirdInningsFirstBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsFirstBattingName":"","ThirdInningsSecondBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsSecondBattingName":"","WinningTeamID":"35","MatchOrder":"Match 14","RevisedOver":"","RevisedTarget":"","PreMatchCommentary":"<p><strong>FIRE UP, FOLKS!

Virat Kohli and Phil Salt at the top? Absolute dynamite. And Rajat Patidar, wearing the captain&rsquo;s armband, has led with purpose and calm&mdash;runs, decisions, presence, he&#39;s ticking all the boxes.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Now here&rsquo;s the sub-plot. Mohammed Siraj&mdash;seven seasons in RCB colours&mdash;now lining up against them. He knows that ground like the back of his hand. And don&rsquo;t be surprised if there&rsquo;s a little chin music when he runs in to bowl to Kohli. That&rsquo;s a mouth-watering face-off. High-voltage stuff, that.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>On the other side, Gujarat Titans have their own trump cards. Sai Sudharsan&rsquo;s in the form of his life. Shubman Gill and Jos Buttler are due, and when they fire, they don&rsquo;t just knock&mdash;they smash the door down. Middle-order?

The square boundaries measure 68 and 61 metres, while the cover and midwicket boundaries stretch to 74 and 68 metres respectively. The shortest boundary &mdash; third man\/fine leg &mdash; is just 55 metres, with a straight hit at 73 metres. It&rsquo;s a dry surface, but local insights suggest it&rsquo;ll offer decent bounce. There&rsquo;s also a chance of dew later, which is why most teams have preferred chasing here.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s live and evenly spread across the center &mdash; the kind of surface seamers like Hazlewood and Ishant will be licking their lips over. Very firm underneath, and visually, you can spot the blend &mdash; a mix of grey and black clay. While it&rsquo;s dry, it should still play true with good bounce. And with those boundary sizes, especially straight down the ground, batters will fancy themselves if the ball comes on.

Losing three made a big difference.Our bowlers were exceptional. They put in a lot of hard work, and despite the total not being easy to defend, they did brilliantly, pushing the opposition till the 18th over.After losing those three wickets, the way Jitesh, Tim, and the other batters came in and batted was fantastic. That was a big positive from this match.We&rsquo;re confident in our batting line-up. They&rsquo;re showing great intent, and that&rsquo;s a good sign moving forward for us.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Shubman Gill | GT Captain: <\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Restricting them to 170 on this ground was a solid effort. This pitch can produce anything&mdash;sometimes it can get you to 250, other times it offers something for the bowlers early on. We knew that if we took early wickets, we&#39;d be in the game. It&#39;s disappointing, but you have to keep coming back and grabbing the next opportunity. With the bat, we adapted well to the situation, and that&#39;s what mattered. It&#39;s all about playing smartly according to the conditions.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Mohammed Siraj | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;It was an emotional moment for me, switching from red to blue after spending seven years here.

I&#39;ve been consistent with my performances, but during the break, I focused on correcting my mistakes and worked on my fitness. When I got picked up by Gujarat Titans, I had a conversation with Ashish Bhai, and Nehra Bhai always tells me to enjoy my bowling. Ishant Bhai helps with my line and length.

Both teams arrive with momentum yet carry distinctly different emotional baggage from their recent performances.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lucknow Super Giants enter the contest with a rollercoaster of emotions behind them. Their recent match against Delhi Capitals was a nail-biting affair that slipped through their fingers, only to be followed by a comprehensive victory against Sunrisers Hyderabad that restored their confidence. The bowling unit, initially struggling without key players Akash Deep and Mayank Yadav, found unexpected heroes in Shardul Thakur and Prince Yadav. Their resurgence couldn&#39;t have come at a better time, especially with the Ekana pitch promising a more bowler-friendly surface.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Punjab Kings, conversely, ride high on the wave of their recent triumph against the Gujarat Titans. Shreyas Iyer&#39;s nearly perfect 97 and the breakthrough performances of Priyansh Arya and Shashank Singh have injected new energy into the squad. Their batting depth looks formidable, though their bowling attack will be tested on a surface that demands precision and strategy.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The match presents a fascinating subtext of individual performances and team dynamics. Nicholas Pooran&#39;s explosive batting for LSG contrasts with Rishabh Pant&#39;s current struggles, while Punjab&#39;s Vyshak Vijaykumar has emerged as a crucial death-over specialist. Mitchell Marsh&#39;s consistent form adds another layer of intrigue to an already complex narrative.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>As the sun sets on the Ekana Stadium, IPLfans can expect nothing less than a thrilling encounter that encapsulates the essence of T20 cricket &ndash; unpredictability, drama, and the potential for individual brilliance to transform a game.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (13)_1743513518.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nStats At Ekana Stadium:<\/strong><br \/>\nIn 13 matches played at this venue, teams chasing have a slight advantage, winning 7 compared to 6 wins for teams batting first.

Known for being a high-scoring venue, this surface offers good <strong>pace and bounce<\/strong>, with nice carry through to the keeper. The ground dimensions provide some relief for bowlers &mdash; it&rsquo;s <strong>70 meters<\/strong> to the right, <strong>64 meters<\/strong> to the left, and <strong>77 meters straight<\/strong> down the ground, which could help contain big hits.The pitch has an <strong>even covering of grass<\/strong>, but there&rsquo;s likely to be <strong>minimal seam or spin movement<\/strong>, making it an excellent surface for batting. It looks absolutely glorious for stroke play, and <strong>chasing might be the smarter option<\/strong> under these conditions.That said, there&rsquo;s a bit of breeze around and while dew is usually expected here, it wasn&rsquo;t present last night. So, while teams may lean toward chasing, <strong>batting first isn&rsquo;t a bad option either<\/strong> depending on strategy and conditions as the game progresses.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (6)_1743514663.gif\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS: <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" \/><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&nbsp;Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Chasing 172, they made light work of the target, breezing to 177\/2 in just 16.2 overs, thanks to a blazing 69 off 34 from Prabhsimran Singh and a captain&rsquo;s knock from Shreyas Iyer.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Electing to bowl first, PBKS got off to a dream start as Arshdeep Singh removed Mitchell Marsh for a golden duck. Despite a counter-attacking 44 from Nicholas Pooran, who hammered 7 boundaries, LSG kept losing wickets at key moments. Ayush Badoni played a gritty hand of 41, and Abdul Samad&rsquo;s late cameo (27 off 12) helped them post a competitive 171\/7.

Oh, it was a Prabhsimran masterclass! The wicketkeeper-batter unleashed his full range&mdash;lofts, scoops, and signature drives&mdash;bringing up his fifty in just 23 balls. A couple of towering sixes over mid-wicket lit up the Ekana night, before he fell on 69. But PBKS didn&rsquo;t break stride.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shreyas Iyer, calm and calculated, anchored the chase with an unbeaten 52 off 30, while Impact Player Nehal Wadhera finished things in style with a rollicking 43*.

The plan was to prepare a slightly slower pitch, and I think we got that. The slower balls were definitely gripping and sticking a bit, but we couldn&rsquo;t capitalize enough with the bat.<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">We&rsquo;ve got to take the learnings from this match and keep moving forward.

What matters most is the camaraderie and the synergy among players&mdash;when that clicks, the results follow. Every team in this tournament has the potential to win; it&rsquo;s about bringing that unified mindset into each game.<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">As for me, I try to stay in the present and not get caught up in what&rsquo;s already done.

Despite Hardik Pandya&rsquo;s return as captain, they fell short against Gujarat Titans. Mumbai&rsquo;s top order &mdash; Rohit Sharma, Ryan Rickelton, and Tilak Varma &mdash; have failed to fire, while the bowling lacks bite without Jasprit Bumrah. Selection confusion has also plagued MI, with in-form spinner Vignesh Puthur left out in the last game despite an impressive outing against CSK.KKR, meanwhile, bounced back strongly with a win over Rajasthan Royals. Quinton de Kock&rsquo;s unbeaten 97 and Moeen Ali&rsquo;s economical spell (2\/23) stood out. The good news for KKR is Sunil Narine&rsquo;s return, setting up a potent spin duo with Varun Chakaravarthy to trouble MI&rsquo;s shaky batting.Wankhede&rsquo;s true bounce and short boundaries should favour big hitters like Andre Russell, while early swing might offer opportunities to pacers like Trent Boult and Spencer Johnson. Dew isn&rsquo;t expected to play a major role, but both teams could still prefer chasing.KKR ended a 12-year winless streak at Wankhede last season and have won five of their last six encounters against MI. With MI facing questions around form and strategy, KKR enter this clash with a slight edge.Will Mumbai finally click at their fortress, or will KKR add to their woes?&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (12)_1743428281.gif\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report:- <\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Eoin Morgan:<\/strong> &quot;We&rsquo;re in for a run-fest on what looks like a batting beauty.

In games like these, it&#39;s often about one big hit &mdash; and we were just one hit away from crossing the line.We gave away 8&ndash;10 runs through misfields, and that&#39;s an area we need to clean up. It&rsquo;s costing us games. That said, 180 was definitely a chaseable total on this wicket. It was a good surface to bat on, especially if you timed the ball well.At one stage, they looked set for 220&ndash;230, so I was happy with how we pulled it back. Historically, we&#39;ve had Ajinkya at No. 3 and Rayudu stabilizing the middle order. So we decided I&rsquo;d shift down a spot, and Rahul (Tripathi) &mdash; who&rsquo;s known for his aggressive starts &mdash; could express himself freely. Not much of a change really, since I&rsquo;m still walking in during the first or second over (smiles).There have been no discussions yet about changing that plan &mdash; it was something agreed upon during the auction. Personally, I&rsquo;m comfortable playing any role &mdash; rotating strike or taking risks when needed &mdash; especially with someone like Shivam at the other end.We haven&#39;t had the best starts so far, but once we get that rhythm at the top, our batting unit will click. There were a lot of positives today &mdash; Noor continues to bowl brilliantly, Khaleel&rsquo;s hitting his lengths, and Jaddu bhai was excellent. We just need that one breakthrough to build pressure. Once our fielding tightens up, we&rsquo;ll be a very dangerous side.&quot;&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Riyan Parag | Rajasthan Royals Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#ff0066\"><strong>&quot;(On the first win as captain) Took just two games, but honestly, it felt a lot longer than that! We still believe we were about 20 runs short today &mdash; we lost a couple of wickets in the middle which slowed us down. But credit to the bowlers, they did an outstanding job defending that total.After two tough outings, our chat was simple &mdash; forget the past, reset, and come out with a fresh mindset. Everyone responded really well.(On not completing Archer&#39;s spell) It was a situational call. Thankfully, we had seven bowling options and went with what felt right at the time. And that fielding effort &mdash; top-notch! We&rsquo;ve been working hard with Dishant Yagnik, our fielding coach, and the results are showing. It made up for the runs we felt we left on the table.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Nitish Rana | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#ff0066\"><strong>&quot;I wanted to take full advantage of the new ball in the powerplay &mdash; that phase is key because once the ball gets older, it slows down and starts gripping. My aim was to play the field rather than focus too much on the bowler or pitch.Whenever fine leg or third man was up, I tried using the pace to place it in those gaps. In the previous two games, I was trying to hit the ball too hard. Today, I focused more on timing and placement &mdash; and it worked.&nbsp;It was a tactical decision from the coaches. I&rsquo;m happy to bat wherever the team needs me. At No. 4, I was over-hitting, and Riyan was doing something similar at three. So we swapped roles, and thankfully it clicked tonight.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n","MatchRow":11,"ProjectedScore":"176","2ndProjectedScore":"0","3rdProjectedScore":"0","MOM":"Nitish Rana","MOM_TYPE":"Batting","MOMPlayerId":"148","MOMRuns":"81","MOMBalls":"36","MOMWicket":"-","MOMRC":"-","MOMImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/BeMSecnzSs1742709231148.png","KO":""},{"CompetitionID":203,"MatchID":1808,"MatchTypeID":5,"MatchType":"T20 D\/N","MatchStatus":"Post","MatchDate":"2025-03-30","MatchDateNew":"30 Mar 2025","MatchName":"Delhi Capitals vs Sunrisers Hyderabad","MatchTime":"15:30","GMTMatchTime":"10:00 GMT","GMTMatchDate":"2025-03-30","GMTMatchEndTime":"14:30 GMT","GMTMatchEndDate":"2025-03-30","FirstBattingTeamID":20,"FirstBattingTeamName":"Sunrisers Hyderabad","SecondBattingTeamID":14,"SecondBattingTeamName":"Delhi Capitals","FirstBattingTeamCode":"SRH","SecondBattingTeamCode":"DC","GroundID":11,"GroundName":"Dr YS Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium","Commentss":"Delhi Capitals Won by 7  Wickets ","TossTeam":"Sunrisers Hyderabad","TossDetails":"Sunrisers Hyderabad Won The Toss And Elected To Bat","TossText":" Won The Toss And Elected To Bat","Flag":1,"FirstBattingSummary":"163\/10 (18.4 Ov)","SecondBattingSummary":"166\/3 (16.0 Ov)","ClientMatchID":"","MATCH_COMMENCE_START_DATE":"2025-03-30 15:30:00","city":"Visakhapatnam","FlickrAlbumID":"","LiveStream":"","FBURL":"https:\/\/www.district.in\/events\/delhi-capitals-team","T20ProMatchID":"","Temperature":"","WeatherIcon":"","TempUpdatedDate":"","GroundUmpire1ID":314,"GroundUmpire2ID":574,"GroundUmpire3ID":87,"RefereeID":87,"HomeTeamID":"14","HomeTeamName":"Delhi Capitals","HomeTeamColor1":"#319490","HomeTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamColor1":"#319490","AwayTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamID":"20","AwayTeamName":"Sunrisers Hyderabad","timezone1":"Asia\/Kolkata","MatchEndDate":"30 Mar 2025","MatchEndTime":"20:00","MATCH_NO_OF_OVERS":"20","ROUND_ID":"0","MatchTypeName":"T20","RowNo":10,"TeamType":null,"CompetitionName":"Tata Ipl 2025","GroundUmpire1":"Ulhas Gandhe","GroundUmpire2":"Abhijit Bhattacharya","ThirdUmpire":"Virender Kumar Sharma","Comments":"Delhi Capitals Won by 7  Wickets ","HomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/SRH.png","AwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/DC.png","MatchHomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/DC.png","MatchAwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/SRH.png","VideoScorecard":0,"TimeZone":"+9.5","CurrentStrikerID":"2022-100mb00000001580-2e206f715b5511","CurrentStrikerName":"Abishek Porel","StrikerRuns":34,"StrikerBalls":18,"StrikerFours":2,"StrikerSixes":2,"StrikerSR":188.88,"StrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/5Jsd7DC7xF17427319861580.png","CurrentNonStrikerID":"2022-100mb00000001017-3e376712cc7911","CurrentNonStrikerName":"Tristan Stubbs","NonStrikerRuns":21,"NonStrikerBalls":14,"NonStrikerFours":3,"NonStrikerSixes":0,"NonStrikerSR":150,"NonStrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/LZ16psu21917427318921017.png","CurrentBowlerID":"2021-100mb00000000630-4155e6ff0bd311","CurrentBowlerName":"Wiaan Mulder","BowlerOvers":"1.0","BowlerRuns":16,"BowlerMaidens":0,"BowlerWickets":0,"BowlerEconomy":16,"BowlerSR":0,"BowlerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/wWS8oWTiPp1742725697630.png","ChasingText":"","MatchBreakComments":"","MatchProgress":"90.00","CurrentInnings":"2","1Summary":"163\/10 (18.4 Overs)","1FallScore":"163","1FallWickets":"10","1FallOvers":"18.4","1RunRate":"8.73","2Summary":"166\/3 (16.0 Overs)","2FallScore":"166","2FallWickets":"3","2FallOvers":"16.0","2RunRate":"10.38","3Summary":"","3FallScore":"","3FallWickets":"","3FallOvers":"","3RunRate":"","4Summary":"","4FallScore":"","4FallWickets":"","4FallOvers":"","4RunRate":"","5Summary":"","5FallScore":"","5FallWickets":"","5FallOvers":"","5RunRate":"","6Summary":"","6FallScore":"","6FallWickets":"","6FallOvers":"","6RunRate":"","DivisionID":"6","SecondInningsFirstBattingID":null,"SecondInningsFirstBattingName":"","SecondInningsSecondBattingID":null,"SecondInningsSecondBattingName":"","ThirdInningsFirstBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsFirstBattingName":"","ThirdInningsSecondBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsSecondBattingName":"","WinningTeamID":"14","MatchOrder":"Match 10","RevisedOver":"","RevisedTarget":"","PreMatchCommentary":"<p><strong>The IPL 2025 carnival continues with Delhi Capitals welcoming Sunrisers Hyderabad to their adopted home in Vizag this Sunday afternoon. Both teams enter this clash with contrasting emotions but similar 1-1 records, setting the stage for an explosive encounter at Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Delhi&#39;s heroic one-wicket heist against LSG, where they chased down 210 from a seemingly impossible position of 65\/5, has injected tremendous belief into Axar Patel&#39;s men. The star of that victory, Ashutosh Sharma, embodied their fearless approach with his match-winning 66 off just 31 balls, dedicated to team mentor Kevin Pietersen with an imaginary switch-hit celebration. Their bowling attack, spearheaded by Mitchell Starc and Kuldeep Yadav, will face its sternest test against SRH&#39;s destructive batting lineup. Starc, in particular, holds a psychological edge over Travis Head, having dismissed the Australian opener cheaply in last season&#39;s Qualifier 1.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The Sunrisers arrive in Vizag, smarting from a rare batting misfire at home. After setting new benchmarks for aggressive batting with 286 against the Rajasthan Royals, they were brought back to earth by LSG, managing &quot;only&quot; 190 despite late fireworks from Aniket Verma and Pat Cummins.DC received a significant boost with KL Rahul&#39;s return after missing the opener due to the birth of his child. His experience will strengthen a top order that faltered badly against LSG, with no batsman in the top five crossing 30. With its shorter square boundaries, the picturesque Vizag stadium has been a batter&#39;s paradise, with recent first-innings scores of 191, 272, and 209. This venue perfectly suits both teams&#39; aggressive batting philosophies. As SRH&#39;s &quot;Travishek&quot; opening duo looks to rebound and DC&#39;s lower order hopes to build on their match-winning momentum, cricket fans can expect another high-scoring thriller in what has become one of the IPL&#39;s most entertaining matchups.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (9)_1743326489.gif\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Danny Morrison:<\/strong> &quot;A bright sunny day greets us here, and we&rsquo;re set for some high-octane action. The dimensions first - square boundaries are 66m and 60m, while straight down the ground is 73m. Short enough for the big hitters to fancy their chances. Now to the pitch &mdash; it&rsquo;s a hybrid with black soil on top and red soil underneath, which means early on, batters could dominate with true bounce and pace. But don&rsquo;t be surprised if spinners come into play later in the innings. Expect runs early, but keep an eye on the grip and turn as the surface wears in.&quot;&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (32)_1743327655.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS UPDATE:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Pat Cummins calls right, and <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/> opts to bat first!&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Didn&rsquo;t put enough runs on the board. A few poor shot selections, and yes, those catches in the deep &mdash; they&rsquo;re part and parcel of T20 cricket, but they do hurt when you&#39;re trying to build momentum. Not a massive margin in the end. On another day, a couple of those shots come off, and the game swings differently. Just wasn&rsquo;t our day. We&rsquo;ll go back, reflect on a few decisions &mdash; both with the bat and ball &mdash; and look at our options. Pleased with Aniket Verma, though. Even before the tournament started, he impressed everyone in the lead-up. What we saw in practice, he brought into the game today. Gave us a genuine chance and showed maturity. It&#39;s still early. Two losses, yes, but nothing to panic about. We regroup, we rethink, and we move forward.&rdquo;<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Axar Patel, DC Captain:<\/strong><\/span>&nbsp;&quot;I&rsquo;ve said it before &mdash; I&rsquo;m going to lead this side with the same mindset every game. In a tournament like this, you can&rsquo;t take any opposition lightly. All 10 teams are quality. Today we stuck to our plans, our processes, and executed really well, which made the difference. The original idea was to give Starc two overs upfront and hold two back for the death. But he was in great rhythm &mdash; I felt he could break the game open &mdash; so I gave him a third, and he got us a big wicket. That proved crucial. &quot;We&rsquo;ve got experienced players who constantly feed in suggestions &mdash; sometimes I take them, sometimes I back my gut. But I enjoy leading this group. Looking ahead to Kotla &mdash; it&rsquo;s a venue we know well. The key will be assessing the surface quickly and adapting. The plans will stay clear; it&rsquo;s all about execution.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Mitchell Starc, Player of the Match:<\/strong><\/span>&nbsp;&quot;It&rsquo;s been a good day &ndash; with the ball, in the field, and with the bat as well. A complete team performance, and I&rsquo;m glad I could contribute to the win.&nbsp;Batters are smarter, matchups are well-known &ndash; so you&rsquo;ve got to think outside the box. Tried to mix it up a bit today, and it worked well. As a senior player, that&rsquo;s the challenge &ndash; keep evolving. You can&rsquo;t just go through the motions anymore. Great energy, great bunch to be around.

Both teams are desperate to open their accounts after suffering defeats in their campaign openers.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>All eyes will be on Hardik Pandya as he returns to lead Mumbai after serving his one-match suspension. His homecoming to Ahmedabad &ndash; where he once led GT to glory before his controversial exit &ndash; adds emotional weight to an already crucial encounter. Gujarat nearly pulled off a miracle against Punjab Kings, falling just 11 runs short of chasing down 243. Their batting firepower was evident as Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler, and Sherfane Rutherford made significant contributions. However, their death bowling was brutally exposed, with only R Sai Kishore emerging with respectable figures. Captain Shubman Gill might consider strengthening their pace attack with Ishant Sharma or Gerald Coetzee waiting in the wings.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mumbai&#39;s batting collapsed in Chennai, managing only 155 against CSK. Rohit Sharma&#39;s four-ball duck set the tone, with Tilak Varma and Suryakumar Yadav unable to capitalize on starts. The silver lining was Vignesh Puthur&#39;s impressive three-wicket haul on debut. The world&#39;s largest cricket stadium traditionally offers batting-friendly conditions, with dew likely to favor the chasing team. Six of eight IPL games played here last season were won by teams batting second. History favors the home side &ndash; Mumbai have never won an IPL match at this venue in three attempts against Gujarat. As Pandya returns to his former hunting ground, both teams know early-season momentum is at stake in what promises to be a fascinating battle under the Ahmedabad lights.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (8)_1743254229.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report |&nbsp;Nick Knight and&nbsp;Michael Clarke<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re back in Ahmedabad, and it&rsquo;s game two at this colossal venue.

But if there&rsquo;s any dew, you&rsquo;d want to chase.

Batting and bowling, we were 15-20 short. There were errors. We were not professionals in the field. That cost us 20-25 runs, which is a lot in T20 cricket. Gill and Sudharsan batted brilliantly. We bowled well, and there were some balls here and there but otherwise, the way they batted was exceptional. They didn&rsquo;t take chances. They hit boundaries. Without taking high risks, they hit boundaries, and we were left with catching up. There shouldn&rsquo;t be a concern. But I think we have to take responsibility. Batters will have to join the party, and hopefully, they&#39;ll join in soon.I was just thinking that I bowled too many slower balls. They saw that the ball was gripping, and those were the toughest balls to face and some were shooting low. It makes life difficult for the batters, and they used them well.&quot;&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">Shubman Gill | Gujarat Titans Captain:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#000066\">&quot;I think yeah, the decision was taken before we played the first match that we will be playing the second match on a black soil wicket. Yeah, that was also another factor. I feel this wicket also suits our batting and as you can see, it worked out well for us.<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"color:#000066\"><strong>That&#39;s one of the factors batting on a black soil wicket. Once the ball gets old, it&#39;s difficult to clear the boundary. We discussed it in the team meeting that we will maximize the powerplay.<\/strong><strong>I think we can all talk about the plan but at the end if you get the desired result, all the things seem to be in place.<\/strong><strong>I don&#39;t know maybe, this could be the first time that he has bowled only 2 overs for us in a match. I actually kept his overs to bowl at the end but with the way the fast bowlers were bowling, I just didn&#39;t want to bring him back in. Prasidh bowled beautifully so I thought why not continue with him.<\/strong><strong>Yeah, we have seen the par score on those wickets so we are looking forward to our next two away games.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Prasidh Krishna | Player of the Match <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/> :<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#000066\">&quot;Nothing much to be honest.

Both teams enter this contest with winning momentum after successful opening games.The last time these teams met produced high drama with RCB&#39;s Yash Dayal defending 10 runs in the final over against MS Dhoni to secure a playoff berth. The wild celebrations at Chinnaswamy Stadium that night have only intensified this rivalry.Chennai holds historical dominance with a commanding 22-11 overall record against RCB, including an overwhelming 8-1 advantage at Chepauk. RCB&#39;s lone victory in Chennai came way back in 2008, the inaugural IPL season.CSK opened their campaign with a tense victory over Mumbai Indians, thanks to their spin trio of Noor Ahmad (4\/18), Ravindra Jadeja, and R Ashwin who strangled MI&#39;s batting. Rachin Ravindra&#39;s steady batting sealed the chase in the final over.RCB, meanwhile, conquered defending champions KKR at Eden Gardens. Phil Salt (56) and Virat Kohli (59*) set the platform with a blazing 95-run opening stand, before captain Rajat Patidar&#39;s quickfire 34 finished the job with 22 balls to spare. Josh Hazlewood and Krunal Pandya starred with the ball.The Chepauk pitch presents a significant tactical battle. RCB&#39;s batting lineup, built primarily for pace-friendly conditions, may struggle against CSK&#39;s world-class spin attack. Only captain Patidar among RCB&#39;s top eight batters has a better strike rate against spin than pace.Conversely, RCB&#39;s spin attack &ndash; featuring Krunal Pandya, an inexperienced Suyash Sharma, and part-time options &ndash; could be vulnerable against CSK&#39;s four left-handed batters. However, early-season Chennai pitches might not yet have developed their traditional spin-friendly characteristics.Bhuvneshwar Kumar might return for RCB after missing the opener with a minor injury, while CSK&#39;s Matheesha Pathirana remains doubtful for the second consecutive game.This clash transcends cricket as it represents neighboring states with passionate fan bases, both worshipping cricket icons who aren&#39;t native to their regions. Though CSK start as favorites at home, RCB&#39;s new-found confidence makes this battle too close to call.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (7)_1743165968.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Teams batting first have had an advantage here in the past, winning 50 of the 87 games played here in the IPL, with the highest score being 246 and the average 1st innings score being 164.

The clash pits last year&#39;s finalists against a completely overhauled LSG side under new captain Rishabh Pant.SRH characteristically began their IPL 2025 campaign, hammering 286 runs against Rajasthan Royals, with Ishan Kishan smashing an unbeaten 106 off just 47 balls. Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma provided the explosive start that has become their trademark, as all six top-order batters struck at 200+ strike rates.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lucknow, meanwhile, suffered a heartbreaking defeat against Delhi Capitals, failing to defend 209 despite being in commanding positions multiple times. The Rishabh Pant era began with promise but ended in disappointment, as their revamped bowling attack couldn&#39;t close out the game.&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>Despite their batting dominance, SRH&#39;s bowling showed vulnerability against Rajasthan.LSG&#39;s bowling worries are more acute with a makeshift attack that features just two specialist pacers. While Ravi Bishnoi and Shardul Thakur bring international experience, they struggled in the opener. The visitors have Avesh Khan joining the squad, but may also consider introducing Caribbean speedster Shamar Joseph.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>LSG&#39;s top order, featuring Mitchell Marsh and Nicholas Pooran, who made impactful contributions against DC, possesses the firepower to match SRH at this venue. However, they&#39;ll need more from Aiden Markram, Pant, and Ayush Badoni, who failed to leave a mark in their opener. The Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium&#39;s surface remains a batter&#39;s paradise. The previous game here saw a staggering match aggregate of 528 runs, and today&#39;s encounter promises more of the same under lights.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Despite SRH&#39;s dominance in their last encounter, LSG holds a 3-1 advantage in their overall IPL head-to-head record. At this venue, the teams have split their two previous meetings. As the Orange Army aims for back-to-back victories to solidify their early-season momentum, the Super Giants will be desperate to get their first points on the board and prove that their new era under Pant has genuine promise.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPL 2025 Head to Head - 640px width (4)_1743082349.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Deep Dasgupta:<\/strong><br \/>\n&quot;Welcome to Hyderabad, where runs have flowed like water in 2024. This season, we&rsquo;ve seen an average of 24 sixes per game, and the last match here dished out 30 sixes and a mind-boggling 528 runs. You might think it&#39;s down to short boundaries&mdash;but hold on! It&#39;s 69 meters to the right, 67 to the left, and 79 straight down&mdash;so it&rsquo;s not the size of the ground. The magic is in the pitch.Tonight, we&rsquo;re on a fresh surface&mdash;unlike the last game&rsquo;s strip, which had a hint of grass. This one? Barren. Bare. Not a blade of grass. It&rsquo;s firm, and you can hear it when you tap it. But look closely&mdash;there are minor abrasions and tiny cracks around the good length areas. Not alarming, but something to keep an eye on. The ball might grip a touch or slow down as it gets older.It&#39;s a red-soil wicket, so expect bounce and carry, especially early. But bowlers beware&mdash;there&rsquo;s no dew expected, just like the last game. That means bat first, go hard, and aim for that 200-plus mark. We might not hit 300 tonight&mdash;but trust me, there are plenty of fireworks in store!&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (4)_1743083956.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE:<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp; Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">????

Despite Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen, and Aniket Verma chipping in, SRH could only post 190\/9 &ndash; Thakur finishing with impressive figures of 4\/34.<br \/>\nThe chase began with an early setback as Markram fell to Shami, but what followed was carnage. Nicholas Pooran unleashed fury with 70 off just 26 balls. Mitchell Marsh matched him with 52 off 31, their 113-run partnership crushing SRH&#39;s hopes.Though LSG lost a few quick wickets afterward, Abdul Samad (22* off 8) applied the finishing touches against his former team. The victory marks LSG&#39;s first points under new captain Rishabh Pant and delivers a reality check to Hyderabad&#39;s explosive batting lineup.With this impressive performance, Lucknow not only win but significantly boost their net run rate early in the tournament.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/image (8)_1743098113.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pat Cummins | Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, it was a different wicket tonight. The key is always to show up with a positive mindset, and credit to them &mdash; they played well.It was still a good pitch. The one the other night was probably the best wicket in the world &mdash; tonight&rsquo;s was the second-best! But yeah, the cutters were gripping a little more today. Every game&rsquo;s a fresh start. I thought we bowled alright &mdash; they just had better plans and executed them well. Losing Ishan and Klaasen early hurt our momentum, but getting up to 190 was still a decent effort.Ideally, you want someone batting through the innings like Ishan did last game. But credit to their bowlers, they kept the pressure on.We&rsquo;ve got a deep batting line-up. The message to the guys is &mdash; if you&#39;re in, go for it. We&rsquo;re not asking anyone to bat 60 balls, but to back themselves and go hard.We&rsquo;ll review this game, look at the one or two moments where we could&rsquo;ve done better &mdash; that&rsquo;s usually the difference in T20s. But like I said last time, we won&rsquo;t get too high or too low. It&rsquo;s a long season &mdash; 14 games &mdash; and we&rsquo;ll move on quickly.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rishabh Pant | Lucknow Super Giants Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Big relief for us. We looked at the positives from the last match and executed much better tonight.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a concern, but we&rsquo;re trying to focus only on what we can control. That&rsquo;s something my mentor always reminds me.The idea was to give him freedom. We know what he&rsquo;s capable of &mdash; if he gets going, it changes games quickly. The environment&rsquo;s been good. Everyone&rsquo;s training hard. We haven&rsquo;t played our best cricket yet, but we&rsquo;re taking it one match at a time and learning with each game.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shardul Thakur| Player of the Match&nbsp;:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Honestly,&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t expecting a late IPL call. I was preparing to play county cricket if things didn&rsquo;t work out. During the Ranji Trophy, I got a call from Zaheer Khan saying I might be picked as a replacement and if I came in, I&rsquo;d start. That moment brought the IPL mindset back. The auction didn&rsquo;t go my way, but I never gave up. Skills are there &ndash; it&rsquo;s about staying in the moment.With the new ball, the plan was simple &ndash; go full and look for swing. We know Abhishek and Head love to go hard, so I thought why not take my chances too? You can pick wickets early if the ball swings. Their top order&rsquo;s been doing the bulk of the scoring at this venue, so we knew that was the moment to strike.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n","MatchRow":7,"ProjectedScore":"238","2ndProjectedScore":"0","3rdProjectedScore":"0","MOM":"Shardul Thakur","MOM_TYPE":"Bowling","MOMPlayerId":"105","MOMRuns":"-","MOMBalls":"-","MOMWicket":"4","MOMRC":"34","MOMImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/WurCOMUnhV1742971632105.png","KO":""},{"CompetitionID":203,"MatchID":1804,"MatchTypeID":8,"MatchType":"T20 (N)","MatchStatus":"Post","MatchDate":"2025-03-26","MatchDateNew":"26 Mar 2025","MatchName":"Rajasthan Royals vs Kolkata Knight Riders","MatchTime":"19:30","GMTMatchTime":"14:00 GMT","GMTMatchDate":"2025-03-26","GMTMatchEndTime":"18:29 GMT","GMTMatchEndDate":"2025-03-26","FirstBattingTeamID":18,"FirstBattingTeamName":"Rajasthan Royals","SecondBattingTeamID":16,"SecondBattingTeamName":"Kolkata Knight Riders","FirstBattingTeamCode":"RR","SecondBattingTeamCode":"KKR","GroundID":44,"GroundName":"ACA Stadium","Commentss":"Kolkata Knight Riders Won by 8  Wickets ","TossTeam":"Kolkata Knight Riders","TossDetails":"Kolkata Knight Riders Won The Toss And Elected To Field","TossText":" Won The Toss And Elected To Field","Flag":0,"FirstBattingSummary":"151\/9 (20.0 Ov)","SecondBattingSummary":"153\/2 (17.3 Ov)","ClientMatchID":"","MATCH_COMMENCE_START_DATE":"2025-03-26 19:30:00","city":"Guwahati","FlickrAlbumID":"","LiveStream":"","FBURL":"https:\/\/in.bookmyshow.com\/sports\/rajasthan-royals-ipl-2025\/ET00434702","T20ProMatchID":"","Temperature":"","WeatherIcon":"","TempUpdatedDate":"","GroundUmpire1ID":261,"GroundUmpire2ID":526,"GroundUmpire3ID":156,"RefereeID":103,"HomeTeamID":"18","HomeTeamName":"Rajasthan Royals","HomeTeamColor1":"#319490","HomeTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamColor1":"#319490","AwayTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamID":"16","AwayTeamName":"Kolkata Knight Riders","timezone1":"Asia\/Kolkata","MatchEndDate":"26 Mar 2025","MatchEndTime":"23:59","MATCH_NO_OF_OVERS":"20","ROUND_ID":"0","MatchTypeName":"T20","RowNo":6,"TeamType":null,"CompetitionName":"Tata Ipl 2025","GroundUmpire1":"Rohan Pandit","GroundUmpire2":"AKSHAY TOTRE","ThirdUmpire":"Adrian Holdstock","Comments":"Kolkata Knight Riders Won by 8  Wickets ","HomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/sSNjJEkBAx1742900310RR---New-Logo.png","AwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/KKR.png","MatchHomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/sSNjJEkBAx1742900310RR---New-Logo.png","MatchAwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/KKR.png","VideoScorecard":0,"TimeZone":"+9.5","CurrentStrikerID":"2019-100mb00000000170-9429250944ae11","CurrentStrikerName":"Quinton De Kock","StrikerRuns":97,"StrikerBalls":61,"StrikerFours":8,"StrikerSixes":6,"StrikerSR":159.01,"StrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/UGAEACmhhE1742551723170.png","CurrentNonStrikerID":"20214a2b63d55d7711ec9c9202ea608","CurrentNonStrikerName":"Angkrish Raghuvanshi","NonStrikerRuns":22,"NonStrikerBalls":17,"NonStrikerFours":2,"NonStrikerSixes":0,"NonStrikerSR":129.41,"NonStrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/KaBY27Licb1742551958787.png","CurrentBowlerID":"2019-100mb00000000181-80151ce844b611","CurrentBowlerName":"Jofra Archer","BowlerOvers":"2.3","BowlerRuns":33,"BowlerMaidens":0,"BowlerWickets":0,"BowlerEconomy":13.2,"BowlerSR":0,"BowlerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/skqIaPdPr81742709187181.png","ChasingText":"","MatchBreakComments":"","MatchProgress":"","CurrentInnings":"2","1Summary":"151\/9 (20.0 Overs)","1FallScore":"151","1FallWickets":"9","1FallOvers":"20.0","1RunRate":"7.55","2Summary":"153\/2 (17.3 Overs)","2FallScore":"153","2FallWickets":"2","2FallOvers":"17.3","2RunRate":"8.74","3Summary":"","3FallScore":"","3FallWickets":"","3FallOvers":"","3RunRate":"","4Summary":"","4FallScore":"","4FallWickets":"","4FallOvers":"","4RunRate":"","5Summary":"","5FallScore":"","5FallWickets":"","5FallOvers":"","5RunRate":"","6Summary":"","6FallScore":"","6FallWickets":"","6FallOvers":"","6RunRate":"","DivisionID":"6","SecondInningsFirstBattingID":null,"SecondInningsFirstBattingName":"","SecondInningsSecondBattingID":null,"SecondInningsSecondBattingName":"","ThirdInningsFirstBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsFirstBattingName":"","ThirdInningsSecondBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsSecondBattingName":"","WinningTeamID":"16","MatchOrder":"Match 6","RevisedOver":"","RevisedTarget":"","PreMatchCommentary":"<p><strong>Local boy Riyan Parag leads Rajasthan Royals&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px;

Let&rsquo;s jump straight into the dimensions: it&rsquo;s 76 meters down the ground, with square boundaries measuring 64 meters on either side &mdash; so fairly balanced, no real bias for the captains to consider. The Royals went with just one specialist spinner in their last game here.&nbsp;Just looking at the surface, it&rsquo;s quite dry, and there isn&rsquo;t much grass cover, especially away from the central strip near the crease. That&rsquo;s a clear sign. Since 2021, the average first-innings score here in T20s is 163, which tells us the pitch tends to slow down slightly.

Despite Moeen Ali falling cheaply for 5 and Rahane departing for 18, KKR never looked under pressure.

He was unbeaten on 97* &mdash; no century, but no regrets either. opened the innings, carried his bat, and handed Kolkata Knight Riders their first win of the season. A proper statement from the left-hander! Earlier in the evening, Rajasthan Royals stumbled to 151\/9 &mdash; the lowest first-innings total this IPL. After a brisk start in the powerplay, they lost momentum quickly. From 67\/1, they collapsed to 82\/5, with Moeen Ali (2\/23) and Varun Chakaravarthy (2\/17) choking the middle overs. Riyan Parag&rsquo;s 25 and Jurel&rsquo;s 33 were the only bright spots. Spencer Johnson was expensive, but Arora and Harshit picked two wickets apiece. Jofra Archer leaked 33 in just 2.3 overs, and Hasaranga struggled with the ball. The Royals were sloppy, with fielding errors compounding their problems.KKR finished it off in just 17.3 overs.

The plan initially was to get Quinny early, but once that didn&rsquo;t happen, we shifted our focus to trying to contain them through the middle overs.Last season, the team wanted me to bat at No. 4 and I embraced that role. This time, it&#39;s No. 3, and as a professional, I&rsquo;m happy to adapt to what the team needs.We&rsquo;ll take the learnings from this game, make sure we don&rsquo;t repeat the same mistakes, and aim to come out with a fresh mindset when we face CSK.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ajinkya Rahane | Kolkata Knight Riders Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&quot;The first six overs were really important and I think we bowled brilliantly during that phase&mdash;conceding just about 40-44 runs and picking up crucial wickets. The middle overs were key too, and that&rsquo;s exactly what we had spoken about before the game. Moeen Ali, coming in for his first match, stepped up big time alongside Varun. Unfortunately, Sunil Narine wasn&#39;t well, but Moeen grabbed his chance and made it count.In this format, you want your players to go out and play fearless cricket. Our batting unit is full of explosive players&mdash;guys who&rsquo;ve done it for the team before. We just focus on giving them the freedom to express themselves. Credit also goes to our bowlers. Moeen&rsquo;s mindset was clear&mdash;he wanted wickets, and that&#39;s exactly what he went after.As for Moeen&rsquo;s role, we gave him complete freedom. He&rsquo;s a quality player, and with his experience of opening in the past, it was a great chance for him to go out there and play his natural game. Very pleased with his contribution.For us, it&rsquo;s about staying in the moment.

It was about playing smart and getting the job done.<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>As for joining KKR, it&rsquo;s been a great experience.

The big-ticket acquisition of Jos Buttler adds serious firepower to an already lethal lineup. <\/strong>Throw in Rashid Khan&#39;s magic and new bowling weapons like Kagiso Rabada and Mohammed Siraj, and you&#39;ve got a nightmare matchup for any opposition.

This is a relatively compact ground &mdash; just 64 meters to my left, 66 meters to my right, and 72 meters straight down the ground.&nbsp;Morgs, what&rsquo;s your take on tonight&rsquo;s surface? This pitch looks pristine &mdash; a lovely even covering of grass which is always a sign of consistent bounce. From my experience, when it looks this good at this venue, there&rsquo;s little for batters to fear. If the ball comes on nicely, expect plenty of boundaries cleared tonight.The stats back that up too. The average first-innings score here is 185, and we&rsquo;ve seen teams cross 200 in 10 of the last 17 games. Dew is expected later tonight, so if you win the toss.You absolutely chase. That&rsquo;s the advantage here. But even if you&rsquo;re sent in to bat first, don&rsquo;t panic &mdash; this surface is a batter&rsquo;s paradise. Get ahead early and keep pushing.

Dropping those chances definitely hurt us, and chasing a target like that was always going to be tough.There was a crucial phase in the middle where we only managed around 18 runs in three overs. Even at the start, we didn&rsquo;t get going &mdash; scored just about 30-40 in the first three overs. That patch probably cost us in the end. Still, I&rsquo;d say there were a lot of positives for us to take, and it&rsquo;s a good starting point for the season&nbsp;It&rsquo;s never easy coming in cold as an impact player after sitting for 15-16 overs and executing yorkers under pressure. Full credit to him and the others for the way they bowled at the death.This is always a high-scoring ground. You might post 230 or even 240 here, but the real challenge is in defending it. That&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll need to address moving forward.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Shreyas Iyer | Punjab Kings Captain &amp; Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;Ecstatic, to be honest. Getting 97* in the first match &mdash; that&rsquo;s just the icing on the cake. There&rsquo;s no better feeling. For me, it was all about adapting quickly. That first boundary off the first ball gave me a massive confidence boost. And that flicked six off Rabada &mdash; I feel like that&rsquo;s when the momentum shifted in our favor.There was a bit of extra bounce early on, but we adapted really well. Shashank&rsquo;s knock &mdash; 44 off just 16 or 17 balls &mdash; was incredible. With the dew setting in, we knew the conditions would tilt slightly, so it was all about execution, and I&rsquo;m glad we did that.Vyshak is such a character &mdash; funny, but with a brilliant attitude. He brings great energy, and it was fantastic to see him bowl with such intent. Arshdeep played a key role too.

The duo launched a brutal assault in the middle overs, hammering 13 sixes between them and propelling LSG past 200. However, DC clawed back late with <strong>Mitchell Starc (3\/42)<\/strong> and <strong>Kuldeep Yadav (2\/20)<\/strong> keeping things in check.

But from 7\/3, the Capitals showed remarkable character. <strong>Ashutosh Sharma<\/strong>, promoted as an Impact Player, played the innings of a lifetime, smashing an unbeaten <strong>66 off 31 balls<\/strong>, including 5 sixes and 5 fours.<\/p>\n\n<p>He found support from <strong>Vipraj Nigam (39 off 15)<\/strong> as the pair stitched a crucial 55-run stand that brought DC back into the contest. The game came down to the final over, with 6 needed.

The batters did really well, but we lost some momentum between overs 13 to 17. Still, it was a competitive total on this surface.As a team, we&#39;re looking to take positives from every game. The more we stick to the basics, the better it will be for us going forward.It&rsquo;s quite clear where it slipped away. This was a good wicket to bat on, and they had two key partnerships &mdash; Stubbsy, Ashutosh, and another guy &mdash; that really took the game away from us.As the ball got older, there was more on offer for the bowlers. We felt the pressure in the final phase. It&#39;s still early in the tournament, and while pressure is part of the game, so is learning from moments like this.Of course, luck plays its part. If that ball had missed the pad, it was a stumping chance. But you can&rsquo;t dwell on these things. The focus has to be on playing good, consistent cricket from here on.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Axar Patel | Delhi Capitals Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;Under my captaincy, you might see a few more thrillers like this!&nbsp;We got the win, so let&rsquo;s not overthink things like why Stubbs bowled or anything like that. After losing four wickets inside the powerplay, it was an outstanding effort from the boys to pull it back and chase this down.Since last year, with the impact player rule, we&rsquo;ve seen this shift. Bowlers are getting hit, but they&rsquo;re also picking up wickets. You have to be mentally ready for that &mdash; if you&#39;re being attacked, there&rsquo;s always a chance to strike back.To be honest, we gave away a few extra runs in the powerplay and dropped some catches too. At one point, it looked like they were heading for 240-250. But the way we bowled in the last seven overs &mdash; giving just 40-odd &mdash; that was a brilliant comeback.We&rsquo;ve been in camp for over a week now, and everyone understands each other&rsquo;s strengths. We saw potential in Vipraj Nigam &mdash; and tonight, he showed why we backed him. I&rsquo;m confident he&rsquo;ll keep growing and deliver in the games to come.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ashutosh Sharma | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;Honestly, this is something I&rsquo;ve been working on since last season. There were a couple of games where I took it deep but couldn&rsquo;t finish &mdash; got out at the wrong time. That stayed with me, and over the past year, I&rsquo;ve made it a focus &mdash; especially in domestic cricket, trying to finish games consistently.I have a lot of belief in myself. I knew that if I could take it into the last over, anything was possible. In T20 cricket, once the equation narrows down, pressure shifts. I just backed the shots I&rsquo;ve been practicing in the nets &mdash; nothing fancy, just execution and self-belief.First of all, hats off to Vipraj &mdash; what a knock! I just kept telling him: if you&#39;re confident you can find the boundary, back yourself and go for it. We kept talking throughout, kept each other calm, and that made a big difference.More than anything, I just wanted to put into play all the hard work I&#39;ve done in training. I&rsquo;m really happy to contribute and would love to dedicate this award to my mentor, Shikhar Paaji (Dhawan), who&rsquo;s not here today but has played a big role in my journey.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n","MatchRow":4,"ProjectedScore":"216","2ndProjectedScore":"0","3rdProjectedScore":"0","MOM":"Ashutosh Sharma","MOM_TYPE":"Batting","MOMPlayerId":"3109","MOMRuns":"66","MOMBalls":"31","MOMWicket":"-","MOMRC":"-","MOMImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/KInNt9N9Nm17427320733109.png","KO":""},{"CompetitionID":203,"MatchID":1801,"MatchTypeID":8,"MatchType":"T20 (N)","MatchStatus":"Post","MatchDate":"2025-03-23","MatchDateNew":"23 Mar 2025","MatchName":"Chennai Super Kings vs Mumbai Indians","MatchTime":"19:30","GMTMatchTime":"14:00 GMT","GMTMatchDate":"2025-03-23","GMTMatchEndTime":"18:29 GMT","GMTMatchEndDate":"2025-03-23","FirstBattingTeamID":17,"FirstBattingTeamName":"Mumbai Indians","SecondBattingTeamID":13,"SecondBattingTeamName":"Chennai Super Kings","FirstBattingTeamCode":"MI","SecondBattingTeamCode":"CSK","GroundID":18,"GroundName":"MA Chidambaram Stadium","Commentss":"Chennai Super Kings Won by 4  Wickets ","TossTeam":"Chennai Super Kings","TossDetails":"Chennai Super Kings Won The Toss And Elected To Field","TossText":" Won The Toss And Elected To Field","Flag":1,"FirstBattingSummary":"155\/9 (20.0 Ov)","SecondBattingSummary":"158\/6 (19.1 Ov)","ClientMatchID":"","MATCH_COMMENCE_START_DATE":"2025-03-23 19:30:00","city":"Chennai","FlickrAlbumID":"","LiveStream":"","FBURL":"https:\/\/www.district.in\/events\/chennai-super-kings-team","T20ProMatchID":"","Temperature":"","WeatherIcon":"","TempUpdatedDate":"","GroundUmpire1ID":159,"GroundUmpire2ID":525,"GroundUmpire3ID":42,"RefereeID":86,"HomeTeamID":"13","HomeTeamName":"Chennai Super Kings","HomeTeamColor1":"#319490","HomeTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamColor1":"#319490","AwayTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamID":"17","AwayTeamName":"Mumbai Indians","timezone1":"Asia\/Kolkata","MatchEndDate":"23 Mar 2025","MatchEndTime":"23:59","MATCH_NO_OF_OVERS":"20","ROUND_ID":"0","MatchTypeName":"T20","RowNo":3,"TeamType":null,"CompetitionName":"Tata Ipl 2025","GroundUmpire1":"KN Ananthapadmanabhan","GroundUmpire2":"Khalid Saiyed","ThirdUmpire":"Nitin Menon","Comments":"Chennai Super Kings Won by 4  Wickets ","HomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/MI.png","AwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/CSK.png","MatchHomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/CSK.png","MatchAwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/MI.png","VideoScorecard":0,"TimeZone":"+9.5","CurrentStrikerID":"2021-100mb00000000724-7645abdd460011","CurrentStrikerName":"Rachin Ravindra","StrikerRuns":65,"StrikerBalls":45,"StrikerFours":2,"StrikerSixes":4,"StrikerSR":144.44,"StrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/v99SAPwBUe1742629192724.png","CurrentNonStrikerID":"2019-100mb00000000057-57100cf415ba11","CurrentNonStrikerName":"MS Dhoni","NonStrikerRuns":0,"NonStrikerBalls":2,"NonStrikerFours":0,"NonStrikerSixes":0,"NonStrikerSR":0,"NonStrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/55sCTAtiqS174262922457.png","CurrentBowlerID":"2019-100mb00000000075-0984e17e1e4011","CurrentBowlerName":"Mitchell Santner","BowlerOvers":"2.1","BowlerRuns":24,"BowlerMaidens":0,"BowlerWickets":0,"BowlerEconomy":11.08,"BowlerSR":0,"BowlerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/FSkDQCKqAk174255342075.png","ChasingText":"","MatchBreakComments":"","MatchProgress":"","CurrentInnings":"2","1Summary":"155\/9 (20.0 Overs)","1FallScore":"155","1FallWickets":"9","1FallOvers":"20.0","1RunRate":"7.75","2Summary":"158\/6 (19.1 Overs)","2FallScore":"158","2FallWickets":"6","2FallOvers":"19.1","2RunRate":"8.24","3Summary":"","3FallScore":"","3FallWickets":"","3FallOvers":"","3RunRate":"","4Summary":"","4FallScore":"","4FallWickets":"","4FallOvers":"","4RunRate":"","5Summary":"","5FallScore":"","5FallWickets":"","5FallOvers":"","5RunRate":"","6Summary":"","6FallScore":"","6FallWickets":"","6FallOvers":"","6RunRate":"","DivisionID":"6","SecondInningsFirstBattingID":null,"SecondInningsFirstBattingName":"","SecondInningsSecondBattingID":null,"SecondInningsSecondBattingName":"","ThirdInningsFirstBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsFirstBattingName":"","ThirdInningsSecondBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsSecondBattingName":"","WinningTeamID":"13","MatchOrder":"Match 3","RevisedOver":"","RevisedTarget":"","PreMatchCommentary":"<p>The <strong>TATA IPL 2025<\/strong> is heating up, and what better way to ignite the tournament than with the biggest rivalry in the league?

We were probably 15&ndash;20 runs short, but the fight the boys showed out there was commendable. That&rsquo;s what MI is known for &mdash; giving opportunities to youngsters and backing them. The scouts work hard for 10 months a year, and Vignesh is a brilliant product of that process.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;I had one over from him up my sleeve in case the game went deep, and when it did, it was a no-brainer to hand him the 18th. He showed great temperament.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;There wasn&rsquo;t much dew, but the pitch was a bit sticky. Credit to Ruturaj &mdash; the way he batted in the second innings took the game away from us.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;It&rsquo;s still early days in the tournament. There&rsquo;s a long way to go.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad (CSK Captain):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>&quot;Happy to be on the winning side. Of course, we would&rsquo;ve liked to be a bit more clinical, but that&rsquo;s how the game goes sometimes.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>&quot;The role I&rsquo;m playing is based on the team&rsquo;s requirements, and if it brings better balance, I&rsquo;m more than happy to adapt and change my position. It&rsquo;s all about what&rsquo;s best for the team.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>&quot;The spinners were spot on tonight. Right after the auction, one of the things we were most excited about was seeing all three of them &mdash; bowling in tandem at Chepauk. That&rsquo;s a big strength for us.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>&quot;Khaleel brings a lot of experience, and Noor is a true X-factor &mdash; that&rsquo;s exactly why we wanted him in the squad. And it&rsquo;s always great to have someone like Ash in the mix as well.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Noor Ahmad (Player of the Match):<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>&quot;It feels really special to play here in the IPL. I&#39;m happy for the team and pleased with my contribution today.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>&quot;The main focus was to keep it simple &mdash; just land the ball in the right areas. The wicket of Surya was a big one, and that stumping by MSD... it was out of this world!&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>&quot;Having Mahi bhai behind the stumps is an incredible support.

23<\/strong>!<\/p>\n\n<p>Both teams have kept their <strong>core intact<\/strong> while making some bold new additions, setting the stage for an epic battle. <strong>SRH, led by Pat Cummins,<\/strong> enter the contest as early favorites, boasting a <strong>well-balanced squad<\/strong> featuring match-winners like <strong>Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen, Abhishek Sharma, and Nitish Reddy<\/strong>, along with a lethal bowling unit of <strong>Mohammed Shami and Adam Zampa.<\/strong>&nbsp;The Orange Army looks primed to go all the way this season!<\/p>\n\n<p>However, <strong>RR won&rsquo;t back down without a fight!<\/strong> With <strong>Sanju Samson nursing a finger injury, young sensation Riyan Parag<\/strong> has been handed the captaincy. The Royals have made <strong>bold moves<\/strong> in their bowling attack, letting go of their iconic trio&mdash;<strong>Ashwin, Chahal, and Boult<\/strong>&mdash;and bringing in the fiery pace of <strong>Jofra Archer<\/strong>, alongside spin wizards <strong>Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana<\/strong>.

Historically, <strong>teams chasing have had the upper hand<\/strong>, winning <strong>43 out of 77 matches<\/strong>, while <strong>teams batting first have secured 34 victories<\/strong>. The <strong>average first-innings score has been 163<\/strong>, with teams managing <strong>47 runs in the powerplay<\/strong> and <strong>43 in the death overs<\/strong> on average.<\/p>\n\n<p>But hold on&mdash;<strong>the past two seasons have flipped the script!<\/strong> In the <strong>last 13 IPL games played here<\/strong>, teams batting first have gained an <strong>edge with 7 wins compared to 6 for chasing sides<\/strong>. More importantly, the <strong>batting-friendly conditions have led to an increase in scoring<\/strong>, with the <strong>average first-innings total soaring to 189!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The <strong>powerplay has seen fireworks, with teams now averaging 56 runs<\/strong>, while the <strong>death overs have become even more explosive, pushing the scoring rate to 49 runs on average.<\/strong> Clearly, Hyderabad is no longer just a <strong>chasing-friendly venue<\/strong>&mdash;it&rsquo;s now a <strong>high-scoring battleground<\/strong> where teams will need to rethink their strategies.<\/p>\n\n<p>With SRH&rsquo;s <strong>explosive top order<\/strong> and RR&rsquo;s <strong>revamped power-hitting unit<\/strong>, this match promises to be an absolute run-fest! <strong>Will the trend of big first-innings totals continue, or will the chasing team regain its dominance?<\/strong> Buckle up&mdash;Hyderabad is set for a thrilling contest!<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Mpumelelo Mbangwa and Michael Clarke:<\/strong><br \/>\n&quot;Dimensions-wise, the square boundaries are 63m and 70m, with 76m straight down the ground. The average score at this venue is 205, but on this specific pitch, it&#39;s even higher at 216. In one word, it&rsquo;s a batting paradise &mdash; an absolute belter, and it has been for quite some time.If we&#39;re nitpicking, both ends of the pitch appear slightly dry, while the center has a touch more grass. That could hint at a bit of two-paced behavior or some grip for spinners &mdash; we&rsquo;re hoping! But make no mistake, with this heat and this surface, it&#39;s the batters who will be licking their lips.If you&#39;re batting first here, 200+ should be the minimum target. It&#39;s tough for a surface to deteriorate in a 20-over match, but ideally, the second innings might offer some grip &mdash; slower balls and spin could come into play. Bottom line: expect runs, and lots of them.&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (29)_1742724521.gif\" \/><\/p>\n\n<div><br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE:&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" \/><span style=\"color:#ff0099\">&nbsp;Won the Toss and Elected to Field First<\/span><span style=\"color:#cc0066\">&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/cricket-ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/><\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">???? ???????????????? ????<br><br>Rajasthan Royals have won the toss and elected to bowl first against Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/TATAIPL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TATAIPL<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/SRHvRR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SRHvRR<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SunRisers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SunRisers<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rajasthanroyals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@rajasthanroyals<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/No3UrY6FA4\">pic.twitter.com\/No3UrY6FA4<\/a><\/p>&mdash; IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/IPL\/status\/1903743243579539702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 23, 2025<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n","PostMatchCommentary":"<p><strong>Powerplay (Overs 1-6)<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>SRH: 94\/1 (15.67 rpo, 15x4, 3x6)&nbsp; <\/strong><\/span><strong>ll&nbsp; <span style=\"color:#ff0099\">RR: 77\/3 (12.83 rpo, 11x4, 3x6)<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Middle Overs (Overs 7-15)<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>SRH: 114\/2 (12.67 rpo, 12x4, 5x6)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><strong>ll&nbsp; <span style=\"color:#ff0099\">RR: 92\/2 (10.22 rpo, 4x4, 8x6)<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Death Overs (Overs 16-20)<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>SRH: 78\/3 (15.60 rpo, 7x4, 4x6)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><strong>ll&nbsp; <span style=\"color:#ff0099\">RR: 73\/1 (14.6 rpo, 2x4, 7x6)<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>What a spectacle at the <strong>Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium<\/strong> as <span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Sunrisers Hyderabad (<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>)<\/strong><\/span> launched their IPL 2025 campaign in <strong>explosive style<\/strong>, crushing <span style=\"color:#ff0099\"><strong>Rajasthan Royals (<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" \/>)<\/strong><\/span> by <strong>44 runs<\/strong> in a high-scoring thriller!<\/p>\n\n<p>After being sent in to bat, <strong>SRH unleashed carnage<\/strong>, posting a <strong>mammoth 286\/6<\/strong>&mdash;one of the highest team totals in IPL history! The charge was led by the ever-destructive <strong>Ishan Kishan<\/strong>, who blazed his way to an <strong>unbeaten 106 off just 47 balls<\/strong>.

Honestly, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be bowling to our batters &mdash; they&rsquo;re unbelievable. Putting up 280-plus is scary. You know you&#39;re going to go for runs, and it&#39;s never easy out there. But when you have that kind of total, one big over can change the game in your favor.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">&quot;We&#39;ve largely retained our core group, and I&rsquo;m really happy with the new additions. Ishan was just incredible today &mdash; what a knock!&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">&quot;The preparation leading into the season has been top-notch. Credit to our coaches &mdash; they&#39;ve been fantastic. Everyone came in fit and firing.

But looking at the score and the team setup, Pat and the coach gave me a lot of confidence. They told me, &#39;Just believe in yourself and enjoy out there.&#39; And that&rsquo;s exactly what I did &mdash; I just enjoyed my time in the middle.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">&quot;I had a good amount of time off between games, and I worked really hard during that period. I gave it everything in practice. A few close people stood by me and helped me stay focused. I just believed in my game and backed myself.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">(On whether he wants to carry this pitch with him everywhere):<br \/>\n&quot;100 percent! When you see Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head batting the way they did, and you&#39;re coming in at No. 3, it gives you so much confidence. You know you can take your time because those two won&rsquo;t stop. You&rsquo;re either walking in very early or with a huge total already on the board &mdash; both situations help you settle in.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">&quot;Of course, posting these kinds of totals every match is tough. But Pat knows what&rsquo;s best for the team. The message is clear &mdash; go out, play with freedom, and enjoy yourself. Don&rsquo;t worry about getting out &mdash; just express yourself.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br

In what was billed as a highly anticipated opener, RCB outclassed the home side in all departments, signaling the beginning of a new era under captain Rajat Patidar.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>After winning the toss and opting to bowl first, RCB had an early scare when Suyash Sharma dropped a sitter in the opening over, giving Quinton de Kock a life. However, Josh Hazlewood dismissed him a few balls later, ensuring the drop didn&rsquo;t cost them. KKR bounced back with a brilliant 103-run stand between new skipper Ajinkya Rahane and Sunil Narine. Rahane looked elegant in his 56 off 31, while Narine bludgeoned 44 off 26. But once Narine fell to Rasikh Dar Salam, the innings lost momentum. Krunal Pandya took charge with the ball, picking 3 for 29, and KKR stumbled to 174\/8.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, RCB&rsquo;s chase was nothing short of explosive. Phil Salt, facing his former team, went ballistic in the powerplay, scoring 56 off 31 balls, while Virat Kohli, playing his 400th T20 match, remained unbeaten on 59 from 36 deliveries. The pair&rsquo;s 80-run opening stand in six overs completely deflated the KKR attack. Despite losing Salt and Padikkal, Patidar smashed a 16-ball 34, and Livingstone wrapped things up with a rapid 15* off 5 balls.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>RCB&#39;s intent was clear &mdash; fearless batting, tight bowling, and capitalizing on big moments. For KKR, this was a wake-up call, especially with the ball, as they failed to defend a competitive total. As the tournament begins to unfold, RCB already look like a well-oiled unit ready to go the distance.<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/Match no 1_1742665294.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>Ajinkya Rahane | Kolkata Knight Riders Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&quot;I thought we were in a strong position until around the 13th over, but then we lost two to three wickets in quick succession, and the momentum completely shifted. It&rsquo;s just the first game of the season, so we&rsquo;ll assess things quickly and move forward.Yes, while I was batting with Venkatesh, we felt 210&ndash;220 was very much on the cards. But credit to RCB &mdash; they bowled exceptionally well in the latter half of our innings.There was a bit of dew, yes, but more than that, I think they batted brilliantly in the powerplay. As I mentioned earlier, a total of 170&ndash;180 on this surface was below par. We were targeting 200-plus, and not getting early breakthroughs with the ball really hurt us tonight.That said, we&rsquo;re not going to dwell too much on this result. It&rsquo;s a long season. We&rsquo;ll regroup, improve as a unit, and come back stronger in the upcoming matches.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rajat Patidar | Royal Challengers &nbsp;Bengaluru&nbsp;Captain:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;There was definitely pressure, but it turned out to be a good day for me &mdash; and if we keep playing like this, I hope there are many more to come.The plan was very clear. I wanted the wicket of Andre Russell at any cost. Even if Suyash went for a few runs, I backed him as our strike bowler &mdash; and he delivered. That moment was crucial.Both Krunal and Suyash deserve massive credit. KKR were flying around the 13th over, but the way they pulled things back was simply brilliant. Their composure turned the game in our favour.It&rsquo;s also a great feeling to lead someone like Virat Kohli &mdash; he&rsquo;s incredibly supportive and having that kind of experience in the camp helps a lot. I&rsquo;m learning every day with this group of leaders around me.&nbsp;Yeah, that was actually a premeditated shot &mdash; I was aiming to go over cover, but the ball nipped back a bit, and it ended up flying over backward point instead. Luckily, it worked out!&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Krunal Pandya | Player of the Match:<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;Honestly, nothing much &mdash; I just realised that with so much crowd noise, it&rsquo;s important to narrow your focus. When I came back to bowl my second over, I zoned in and just focused on delivering good balls. I&rsquo;m happy I could step up and contribute for the team.In T20s, if batters want to go big, they&rsquo;ll have to do it against my best deliveries. That&rsquo;s the mindset. These days, batters have so many options and skills &mdash; as a bowler, you&rsquo;ve got to keep evolving with the game. Everyone talks about changes of pace &mdash; usually about pacers &mdash; but for spinners too, variation in speed is a powerful weapon. I&rsquo;ve got a wide yorker and even a bouncer in my toolkit, and Jitesh Sharma is well aware of that. He&rsquo;s always ready, which gives me the confidence to execute those variations when needed. Joining RCB has been incredible. The energy around this franchise is unreal. Even when I played domestic cricket in Bengaluru, I could hear RCB chants from the stands. It&rsquo;s been only ten days with the squad, but it already feels like something special.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n","MatchRow":1,"ProjectedScore":"216","2ndProjectedScore":"0","3rdProjectedScore":"0","MOM":"Krunal
